<p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong> The <strong>Black Lives Matter Global Network</strong> believes that <strong>&ldquo;state-sanctioned violence and
anti-Black racism&rdquo;</strong> is the political problem in America today, and repeated it twice.</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter sounds like an obvious true slogan, but it also the name of a political group.
I recommend you search the internet for

At the top, you will find a manifesto, a declaration of the intentions and views political organization.
It is only 787 words; 37 sentences.</p>

Let&rsquo;s get past the slogan and see what we find.</p>
