Lets make a movie together. Down in my dm! 😂😂
Ese tipo de lugares son la imagen viva de dolor, miseria, egoísmo, maltrato y muchas cosas más pero usted teniendo la posibilidad de ayudar por este tipo de medio a difundir esa información no lo hace. Que asco me da usted que teniendo la posibilidad de ayudar a las causas nobles no lo hace y por el contrario genera más violencia con visitas e imagenes de este tipo.
😢 Es una mentira que les importen los demás, es mentira que quieran ayudar, no sirven tantas campañas en contra del maltrato, en contra de la guerra, en contra del hambre, es mentira todo. Si nos dejamos de ver nuestras diferencias jamás lograremos un cambio positivo.

@lillymillersucks
@kelsiee_renee I grew up on Whidbey Island, WA, and I can tell you for FACT that the footage in Blackfish of the Orca captures in Penn Cove is absolutely accurate!  I used to go to Penn Cove in the mornings before school to watch the beautiful Orcas swimming with their families. That is, until Sea World, Miami Seaquarium and other “sea parks” came to our cove...they killed numerous Orcas as they attempted to catch their next money-making “Shamus”. As a 10 yr old girl I saw firsthand the dead orcas on our beach. Yes, Sea World participates in this travesty. I watched it with my own eyes. I have two friends who used to work at Sea World (one as a dolphin trainer, the other with the orcas); they have had the courage to share the truth of what goes on behind the scenes at Sea World. They truly love animals as I’m sure you do, and they had the integrity to leave their jobs at Sea World and share the truth with others. #emptythetanks #dontbuyaticket

❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😍
@therock You should be ashamed of yourself. I hope your kids grow up more educated than you obviously did and teach you why captivity is so cruel and especially the Georgia Aquarium to be specific and ESPECIALLY when it comes to their beluga whales.....Can you try to be smart about something???????
In awe but this beautiful creature should be in the ocean not in a small pool :(
Hey @therock there is similar to @tyrese  Gibson 😝😂

@lifestyles_of_leonie 👍👍👍
That's cool
@lovee.lanae  ooooowwwwooooooo
@amilton_cesar_99
@kelsiee_renee does that make it more right to restrict them from their species? Their family? Would you want to live in a small room all your life?
@s.v.tomaszewski the Georgia Aquarium doesn't determine that. SO you can take out your grievances with the government. If an animal is born into a zoological setting then they cannot be released 😂 it's that simple.
@s.v.tomaszewski thank you for proving my point you lib.
@kelsiee_renee so animals in captivity is a laughter matter for you? Really mature
@s.v.tomaszewski okay 😂 you have no better come back to what I said, but to attack my emoji usage? Bye, babe.
"@kelsiee_renee no since I thought it was obvious in my last answer, this wouldn’t have happened if people like you understood that animal in captivity is wrong.
Guess we aren’t so far from the Stone Age after all.

@alevaley ME ENCANTA😍
ZOOS AND AQUARIUMS DO GOOD. 💕💕💕
@kristopher___millls it can't just go into the ocean. Also NOAA is in charge of that not Georgia Aquarium...
@nadiavincenza lol @ Blackfish not credible. Next
@kelsiee_renee ok
@kelsiee_renee do u work at sea world
@kristopher___millls yes. Why?
@kelsiee_renee it’s my dream job
@kristopher___millls but you're on here typing "set it free" on a picture of a beluga from Georgia Aquarium????
@kelsiee_renee yeah but I’m just saying in my opinion that beluga should be in an ocean. Not in a large tank
@kristopher___millls you'll have a hard time at SeaWorld then, bud.
@kelsiee_renee Wait aren’t sea world shutting down their orca shows
@kristopher___millls No. They still have orca shows. San Diego is phasing them out, but the other two parks still have them and are gearing towards educational shows. Also the orcas aren't going anywhere.
@kelsiee_renee ok
@kelsiee_renee when San Diego phase them out will it just have dolphins
@kristopher___millls I'm not sure what shows they will have and what they won't. I work at San Antonio.
@kelsiee_renee no probs anyways thanks for answering my questions
@kristopher___millls if you have any others let me know. You can DM me.
@kelsiee_renee ok thanks
@kelsiee_renee ok thanks
Wooow👏
@niklasdossantos
It looks like a statue
@kelsiee_renee yes some times but not when ur an animal stolen from your mother and put in. A cage for the rest of ur life
@kelsiee_renee lol you work at SeaWorld. Your comment...not credible. Next.
@nadiavincenza if you literally look up "Blackfish inconsistencies" the first result is a PDF. Rewatch it with that in front of you.
@yo_mils_yo all the belugas at Georgia's aquarium were born into a zoological setting.

Beluga whales don’t belong in captivity 😞
@adriandezzy She is not “triggered”, she is standing up for the creatures who can’t. Large aquatic animals such as belugas travel for miles a day and stay hundreds to thousands of miles below water. In captivity, they are limited to only so many square feet, and they are under-stimulated, bored, and stressed. It’s not okay.
@ele.phan.ts ofc it’s not okay, but this picture is not inferring that the rock doesn’t want to animals to be free. She jumped to that conclusion based off a photo.  And I’m not reading what you type because it’s probably some generic “Animals can’t speak and animals shouldn’t be in captivity” well ofc
@adriandezzy He’s literally promoting this aquarium but I’m not going to argue with you if you choose not to even read these. Your point can’t be valid if you don’t even listen to the other side of an argument.
@ele.phan.ts Just because he posted a picture promoting an Aquarium doesn’t mean he wants animals in captivity.
@ele.phan.ts if you want to jump to that conclusion then go ahead, but making premature conclusions based off a picture doesn’t make you correct
@ele.phan.ts also I commented that 6 weeks ago, either you have no time on your hands, stalking the rocks ig pics, or you’re triggered.
Those are amazing creatures

O yeah. Amazing see a mammals that could swim for miles in open ocean, imprisioned in a cage just for the sake of profit. @therock i'm really worried when people like you who have the power to educate the mass on the contrary show ignorance themselves. Beluga usually are catched in russia, deprived of their freedoom and sold at hundred of dollars. In acquarium, they suffer of looniless, depression, health issues and are  trained to do innatural behaviour. These mammals often die prematurely due to the captivity. It is really sad that insted of educate about preserving oceans your are advocating for the god of profit. And there is no benchpress or squat that could make this more appealing. #noherohere
@icharlottebuckley These animals would be dead without the aquarium

@therock I think it’s sad that you would participate in something that is so cruel. You are right, these animals are highly intelligent and deserve better than being forced to entertain you at will and forced to live in a cage for life. This is a sad existence, I hate that you are participating in this!

How does having a whale in captivity cool? Think about it people. Watch the documentary blackfish and stay woke. We must stop this cruel industry and not support the people who promote it for their selfish agendas.

@therock you are awesome! Dont listen to these idiots...aquariums are amazing and i am so glad you and your family got to go and wnjoy those amazing animals!!! Alot of us that live in the midwest dont get to see some of these animals because we are nowhere near the beach or get to go on excursions to see them...alot of these people dont realize that alot of the animals have been rescued and cannot be put back into the ocean..let them be idiots,  you do you!!!!
How far
This animal should live free in The ocean. This picture is very very sad and show all the stupid power of men. We will pay a very salty bill from the animals one day.
@flynnpictureco they have to live free in the ocean
And remembers the day he was torn from the sea and thrown into a pool. Forever.
😍😍😍
So sad to see an animal as you say, staggeringly intelligent being kept like this away. Whales as most animals need space and natural environment and most of all their families just like us. Aquariums will hopefully become a thing of the past very soon and open water sanctuaries be an option to give this wonderfully creature a life of retirement in a more natural environment. Please stop promoting this type of cruelty as a good thing!
Never ok to support and lend your voice for captivity!
Wow 😮
@therock  please take a moment to watch The cove and Blackfish

@dankje_hd usually the animals are hurt and can't go back or the aquarium is trying to preserve a species from extinction
It’s skin is smoother than silk! 💧
@theneonrunner KILL YOURSELF, JUST FUCKING DIE! Nobody cares that you think this is wrong, because there is a hell of a lot more ppl who don’t care and think it’s cool to see these animals. No one cares that you are not his fan because there are millions, MILLIONS who do still love this guy. You are a price of shit, that should have never been brought to this earth, and is another SJW THAT DESERVES TO BE SHUT OUT AND NEVER HEARD FROM AGAIN!
@shriya_saran1109 You don’t deserve to be alive. Do us all a favor and stop spreading your SJW opinion around because when you do that you knock 30 years off my life. Nobody cares that you think this is cruel, because it’s not. They are used to humans now, and saying that they have to work for food is fucking retarded. You realize animals hunt right?! They work harder in the wild. And let me guess you think having a pet dog is a huge problem as well. I’ve got news for you, more than half the population of earth disagrees with your knowledge. Stop being an SJW scumbag, and start realizing that no one, NO ONE GIVES A SHIT ABOUT YOUR OPINION!
@wrigleylindav sigh you should really do more research. You need to lay away from the internet before I go off on you too.

This is wrong @therock in so many levels. I intend that all of the zoos and aquatic theme parks be closed within this year. I admire you, your work, your family. But this is a total deception.  We humans have the priority to be the voices of the animals, to defend d them and nurture them with love. These parks are prisons and not their natural habitat. This is cruelty. Have you thought what you are teaching to everyone who follows you?  This is abuse and you are teaching them to abuse animals. In awe? Really? With you money you should do something to take them back to the sea.
@aarontaylor03 I can tell you firsthand that the Penn Cove orca whale captures documented in Blackfish are ACCURATELY portrayed in the film. I know this because I grew up on Whidbey Island and was actually standing on the dock in Penn Cove where I witnessed the dead orca whales on our beach. The orca whales that were killed by the Sea World, Miami Seaquarium and Marineland hunters. They killed numerous orca whales in our cove, in their attempts to catch their next money-making “Shamus”. It was the most heartbreaking, disturbing thing I have ever witnessed in my life. And then, Sea World lied about it to the press. Those of us who lived on Whidbey Island and saw the slaughter with our own eyes...well, we will never forget it. Sea World and other marine parks are absolutely about greed and profit. Please don’t be fooled by propaganda and PR.
You found your twin! Awesome 👏🏽!!!
@flynnpictureco sad they are locked in a tank intelligent animals should not be show cased it is cruel

Please please no..... use your fame to end captivity instead. They are not meant to be in a pool. Thank you 🙏🏼
I've always loved you Dwayne but this has broken my heart. Come on man, we both know that poor think deserves to be at sea or a whale sea sanctuary Atleast not for entertainment.
👌👏
👍👍👍
People are being so insanely judgemental not realizing that many of the animals that GA Aquarium acquires are rescues rehabs, or were born in captivity. Additionally, the amount of research  and other conservation/environmental services the aquarium provides outside of Atlanta is huge. Even if only just a few people are inspired by seeing these animals up close and personal, then who knows what difference those few could make.

Thank you for taking the time to see first hand how loved and well taken care of these animals are by their trainers and caregivers! Education is extremely important and it’s challenging to find critical thinkers in this day and age who are willing to take the time to learn the facts. Your open minded-ness is greatly appreciated and respected by all of us in the animal care and training field! Again, thank you!! ❤️
This is epic this animal is smarter then meh

Hi Dwayne, I'm from Santa Catarina/Brazil and I'm a very fan of your work, not only on big screen but in bodybulding too. I lost 80 pounds in 4 years, and for me, your motivations message was very important. My husband and daugther question me why I don't send you a message, and here I am. If can you say "Hi" for me, I'll very grateful. Keep going this great person you are, and keep motivating all of Us. Best Regards... xx's
This is not ok those animals are trapped
I love it

@therock Imagine your daughter being kidnapped from you and your wife... then being sold to scumbags for entertainment... then millions of people paying good money to go watch your daughter, who has been tortured relentlessly, to entertain them and make them smile as they cheer her pain on. Does that make you feel good ? Every life matters, stop with these posts they are disturbing.

Lucky to be that close to an beautiful whale.
😙😑😶😎🤗😘😗🙄
not funny 😪
Thank you
I love beluga
@shefxli this aquarium attempts a breeding program of belugas without any success. Yes, that means they try to breed them strictly for the purpose of entertainment. They have been unsuccessful, that means the unnecessary deaths of young beluga calves. There is no moral or ethical argument you can make to justify this. Google Georgia aquarium beluga deaths and see the facts for yourself instead of making up nonsense that sounds like a fairy tale, educate yourself!
@kelkel824 yes! But he didn't come to dolphin, I didn't even know he was there! He was literally on the left side of the wall! 😫
@jasonbolalek ok jeez I didn’t know, I just wanted it not to be true, I like to think the good in people, but I guess that’s not always true so you’re right.

@i.am.meha what the fuck?? Why would you want that?? How would you like to be put in a cage for the rest of ur life??
Love this animal...one of my absolute favs❤
@amanda.0512 because that person is sad, angry, and lonely. People like that want the world to feel the same way they do as punishment for what they themselves endured. Its weakness and despair. I pity @i.am.meha
This is so adorable!  I now want to travel to this aquarium with my children.  It looks amazing!
Swag
@itsjustarash I don’t need your pity. Like the Rock doesn’t need you to tell him what he can and can’t do.
@amanda.0512 how about you leave him alone and focus on you. It’s his choice to go to the damn aquarium.
@i.am.meha not talking about him, I’m talking to YOU
@tittone77
Mdrrrr tema le front du dauphin, il galère @claudia_isayah

@mannysportstraining
@amanda.0512 my point for the post are people complaining about him visiting an aquarium so what it’s his life. Some of us do like going to aquariums and zoos. If you don’t like it that’s your thing.
@amanda.0512 These animals are probably safer in an aquarium considering the filth on the ocean. Like the straw ban because it’s oh so harmful to them. Not to mention all the other crap in the waters.
@i.am.meha no pool is big enough for them, they need to be free. THE FILTH IN THE OCEAN IS OUR FAULT
@amanda.0512 so they are better in captivity because some people don’t really care about the pollution in the ocean. Some don’t even care about recycling
@shriya_saran1109 that’s not how that works...at all...most if not ALL the animals in aquariums or Zoos are animals that have been recused by humans and have been taken under our care because they are unable to do so, so please how about YOU educate yourself, the only aquariums and zoos who would steal the animals are usually the ones that are shady to begin with
@shriya_saran1109 that’s not how that works...at all...most if not ALL the animals in aquariums or Zoos are animals that have been recused by humans and have been taken under our care because they are unable to do so, so please how about YOU educate yourself, the only aquariums and zoos who would steal the animals are usually the ones that are shady to begin with
Alright for those of you complaining that this is wrong I suggest you guys go do your research, THESE ANIMALS are cared for tremendously, most if not all of these wonderful creatures are in there because they were recused by humans and have been cared for, some of these animals they can never go back to the wild because they wouldn’t survive in it! That is why they are there, so that they could live their lives in peace and educate us, I can tell you first hand from my brother who worked at a zoo that had an aquarium that they get fed well, they get plenty of exercise and they love being there in the company of humans, THE REASON THEY’RE IN THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE IS BECAUSE THEY WERE SAVED AND ARE INCAPABLE OF SURVIVING ON THEIR OWN! GOD THIS WORLD IS FULL OF STUPID UNEDUCATED SNOWFLAKES!
@shriya_saran1109 Amen
If I have the rock money I will buy 5 islands and save all the animals

Wow you are best
@brandonr2300 I assume you refer to yourself as an uneducated snowflake also? “They like being here” when did you learn to speak whale? Please tell me more. 🙄
@eb_8_8 sure no problem m8! You see these creatures were saved by humans because they were near death or extinction, and so since we saved these beautiful creatures they live a life of luxury, with plenty of space to move around, all they can eat AND they don’t have to worry about predators, it’s like if people started bitching about me giving a homeless man about to die a home, will you guys be saying “oh you’re keeping him prisoner there!”, so please just stop and educate yourself, have a nice day 🙄
@brandonr2300 first of all...they were not “saved” they were once wild and then they were captured and placed in a concrete tank Deprived of everything that is natural to them. Sensory deprivation, foraging, family, swimming miles and miles in one day...the list goes on. Secondly, the reference to the homeless man has absolutely no point to it . it’s two completely different situations. As for saying they live a life of luxury I suggest you watch blackfish an educate yourself. Repeatedly banging your head against metal bars because you are so frustrated is not luxury. Not being able to escape a fight with your tank mate so you are essentially bleeding to death is not luxury. Being starved of food so that you perform on cue is not luxury. It’s over exploiting an animal for your own selfish gain nothing about this is right or ‘doing them  a favour”.
Wow it's will be so amazing.
This isn't ok they are beautiful intelligent creatures just like you, why do you support their captivity
Not in captivity. Just so awful and sad. Please don't condone it

@theneonrunner it's not about the number... that is where this generation fails. Your reasoning is flawed. Middle Ages ? That's your cop-out ? That doesn't save your skin, Sister. I'm all for the Animals but you are aiming your transgressions at the wrong person. It shouldn't be toward The Rock or other celebrities who have no idea what happens to the Animals. Your anger should be aimed toward the source. I'm all for the Animals but I'm not for you all shooting your anger off in all directions and completely missing the source. Lock in on the source.

You dont give a shit about them you pathetic leach you are using them because you wouldnt even be recognized if you did babble some emotionless crap about your care for them. You are fucking pathetic

😨😤😭 👎👎 @therock
They are probably in there FOR FUCKING CONSERVATION. THEY RESCUE AND HELP SICK AND INJURED SEA ANIMALS. Or use them for breeding programs. You're all saying how beautiful they are. Well if they weren't saved then the damn things would go extinct. I totally agree with not keeping them captive for no good reason. But hardly anywhere does it for a bad cause. In fact the rock probably put in donations to help these beautiful creatures.
@creepylive it’s not my fault Generation Y o Y has the attention span of a gnat.
@usrfd1212 Nope, never, and people with your mentality should not have animals in your care. Please stop your archaic compartmentalised speciesism drivel.

I doubt that any of the sniveling whiners we see here have or would every pay to see one of Rock's movies
@home.of.the.freestyle because this animal has been taken from its natural habitat to be trained and exploited for entertainment. It is so sad. This whale is one example of a beautiful majestic creature who has been belittled into doing party tricks. This aquarium recently tried to import belugas caught in Russian waters until the US government stopped them. Even if any of their animals are "rescued," they are taught to perform like a circus animal and not given the respect they deserve. This is not healthy for the animals.
Bellissimaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
@growingwithgladys
@themadblaxican Sea World is an Aquarium too. Sea World does more rehab/release than any other company in the world! Just FYI.
@litter_ystwyth ok. At least I'm real. Take a good look at yourself and your belongings and surroundings. You are full of crap if you expect any one to believe that all you have and utilize has never come at the price of an animals well being. Hell the phone or computer you use to post has an animals suffering or displacement attached to it. So how about you just shut up and stop preaching.

@litter_ystwyth so what you are saying is no advance in science and the medical field. No lives saved. None of this was made possible by studying the animals in the wild and in a controlled environment?
@usrfd1212 Nothing that exploits and perpetrates suffering upon non consenting living beings could ever be described as an ‘advancement’ of the human race. It keeps us as sadistic upright apes torturing and exploiting those who are defenceless and have no choice. Which is fcuking sick, not in the slightest progressive and marks our humanity with a big black stain. Nothing achieved this way is an advance. It’s regressive and totally at odds with true research and a future where we hold creatures in chains, and expect to learn anything from an animal in chains, where we finally learn to engage and interact with other species on their own terms. People are turning their backs for very good reason. It’s immoral, end of.
@usrfd1212 *don’t* hold creatures in chains.
@therock WHY??????? #youshouldknowbetter #nevermeetyourheroes 😔

@litter_ystwyth sorry. You have been out of touch way to long. I agree some methods are wrong and those few need to be punished harshly. But in large it is human and needed. So please stop with your unrealistic babble.

@flynnpictureco What a sad day and Life for this beautiful soul
@408.destiiny I must be confused then, how is this picture a “special day”?
@therock This truly breaks my heart.
Maybe you should watch Blackfish....Rock.  Get up to speed.
@shaybart
I love it! It’s a wonderful creature. So cute!!!
Shame on you
Oof, that's my buddy, Jimbo 🐳 @lolo.burton

@theneonrunner why?
Beautiful
That's so cool!
Love you man
Very beautiful
Just watch „Black Fish“ ... after you will not visit an aquarium again. Especially as a person with so much influence you could educate people for a better. „The Cove“ is a good documentation to have a look behind the whole industry as well. It’s never too late to change your mind : )
Whaou 😍
Rock & animal
Lol fist bumping a dolphin
😆😃it’s so cute
I'm be your co-star
💜Beluga Love💜
@glaucialolli stfu
@ellispeteellis ffs loosen up a bit it’s a picture of him playing with a whale.If u care so much go sue the damn aquarium and do something about it.
@toddschroeder_ Omg loosen up ffs stop assuming he is for animal cruelty, if he was aware of this he sure wouldn’t have payed his own money to support these aquariums.Gosh y’all people get triggered so damn fast.He’s enjoying himself.

Hopefully this is the start of something here, you influence so many people. Many of us once believed the education and conservation argument places like these feed to us. And many of us later realized that we were wrong for believing them. You can change your mind. We can't know what we don't know. Please research animals in captivity, you acknowledge their intelligence so please don't underestimate it. You can show your followers that the truth is sometimes hard to see at first and that it is okay to change your view.
That's so Cure:3
Wow... so disappointing. You’ve used your huge platform to romanticise exploitation 💔
Good baybe

SHAME ON YOU 😡 why are you doing this to those animals. Respect them 😡😡😡😡

So disappointed you support  this! Educate yourself!!!
@iokau900 I think you’ll find this mindset is fast becoming increasingly unpopular, damn right too. Let’s all put them in a glass box and preserve them in an entirely unnatural state and call it ‘education’. Please 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
@vegan_beginning no I'm actually very well educated but can't stand people that must always comment negative things about everything. The rock was having a day with his family and people lost their shit. Zoos and sealife parks do wonderful things in regards to conservation and education. Your vegan I get it and that's great and I'm omnivores and that's fine as well. My point is he's living his life and if that means visiting a sealife Park so be it but the negativity does absolutely nothing for anyone.

"@rebecca_b_land  this is based on OSHA hearings and testimony as well as scientific studies: 
http://da15bdaf715461308003-0c725c907c2d637068751776aeee5fbf.r7.cf1.rackcdn.com/adf36e5c35b842f5ae4e2322841e8933_4-4-14-updated-final-of-blacklist-list-of-inaccuracies-and-misleading-points.pdf"
@aarontaylor03 your link doesn’t work
"Also, something entitled ‘Updated  final of blacklist list of inaccuracies and misleading points’ doesn’t fill me with confidence of its origin. 
If you feel BlackFish is nonsense, so be it. Science, experience, evidence - and latterly - legislation by government holds an opposing view. Without doubt, zoos and aquaria contribute massively to education and conservation research, however our knowledge of animals and their requirements has progressed. So zoos and aquaria need to as well."
Wow
@rebecca_b_land copy and paste... links don’t work on insta. Z....or I can DM you. Up to you.
Nice
👎🏼Not cool!
Que hermosa esa ballena piloto
@aarontaylor03 regardless of that list, OSHA upheld (repeatedly) the ruling. Even on something basic like her arm - that they quibble over whether he digested it or not, he bit it off....what about that is safe? What about that is normal for a killer whale?
Funny all the hate on here for an all around good guy,people on their high horse pretending like they haven’t had a burger or went to an aquarium or zoo and taken these same photos.  Except they post them and no one cares.  Stay in your lane and let the man live, it affects your life in no way.  @therock  keep electrifying and doing your thing.
How do you do that
@therock you just destroy years and years of campaign to protect and avoid captivity of dolphins , whales and orca ! This is just stupid and these creatures need your help to be free !!
♥♥♥
@vegan_beginning :)
@jamesmillegan really not all smiles when you clearly haven’t got a clue... your comment doesn’t make sense bro
@rebecca_b_land I know better than to argue against someone with 25 years of experience lol, so maybe GA isn't the best aquarium, but I still do not believe the animals are being abused.
@aarontaylor03 Lol
@shriya_saran1109 Shut the fuck up like just shut up
@shriya_saran1109 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Why are you supporting the captivity of wild animals ? This beautiful creature should be back in the sea where he belongs, not making money for you. Shame on you.
This is an amazingly beautiful creature. Too bad it will live it’s life as entertainment for fucked up humans that can’t find other ways to amuse themselves other than holding other beings that we share this planet with captive after tearing it apart from their beautiful free lives with their own families... fuckin pathetic
Cute

@steveo please educate @therock on why we shouldn't support animals in captivity 💙🌊
@i.am.meha I really agree that you shouldn’t judge people for their lifestyles but you can certainly inform them if their doing anything harmful to another being
I love you turkey love you therock
Why are you posing with an animal who is in captivity?! This poor whale has no life!!! No choice!!! This here is you with a slave!!! Wake up @therock

@aarontaylor03 well - aside from 25 years experience of cetaceans, a marine biology degree (and a Masters) - I did list them 👆🏼Which part is false? It’s been passed in law that SeaWorld were negligent due to the prior knowledge of the zoochotic behaviour of the killer whales. It’s public record. It’s scientific record. “In addition to the history with this whale, the OSHA investigation revealed that SeaWorld trainers had an extensive history of unexpected and potentially dangerous incidents involving killer whales at its various facilities, including its location in Orlando. “  https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/national/08232010-0

@aarontaylor03 If you think an animal being starved to perform for ‘entertainment’ is bullshit, then you’re more stupid than I thought. Maybe you ought to ask the experts, people that have actually known how much these animals suffer!!! @walrus_whisperer @peggy_oki @orcaingrid @johnjhargrove @richardobarry @casey_pup
@dollfin74 I never said that. I just said Blackfish was bullshit.

@aarontaylor03 no it isn’t. Ask former trainer @johnjhargrove I think you’ll find he knows more than most. He’s witnessed exactly what happens to those Orcas when the public go home :( Have a nice day :)
@aarontaylor03 Blackfish is about exactly that... animals starved to perform for $$$$$ It’s disgusting.
You are the worst for supporting this enslavement
@dollfin74 that entire documentary isn’t all about that one single concept. Don’t forget, those filmmakers are all about the $$$$$ too. And I know trainers that currently work there. That doesn’t happen. Maybe it did before 20+ years ago, but certainly not now.
@dollfin74 I too have thought of @therock as an actor I have enjoyed in many movies. And I LOVED😘him as Bambi in Saturday Night Live's spoof about hunters. Too cute and handsome. If you are reading this dear Rock, I hope that you will watch the Oscar🏆winning documentary "The Cove" to learn about the #cruelty from capture to captivity of these highly intelligent, socially, matriarchally bonded 🐬🐳Beings! I can see the stoke you felt in "meeting" a Beluga Whale. They are awesome! From my own encounters with Dolphins & Whales in the wild I have been inspired in a life changing way! These Beings freely chose to come to me! You had the choice to freely go and visit this facility. Sadly, these beautiful Beings have #nofreedom. They are deprived of food as they are forced to perform tricks.😞Most were torn from their families forever. My dear beautiful friend, 💜African American singer #robynnekaamil 🙏🏽sang a song of #freedomforlolita 🐳because of her heritage, an ancestry of #slavery ⛓⛓⛓Please consider how wrong #dolphinsincaptivity is. I want to say I love ❤️ you!
"Dont ever support animal in captivity 👊🏽
Shame on you @therock 🤬"
@dollfin74 I can also DM you a link that gives 69 reasons why #Blackfish is nothing but bullshit. It cites the actual OSHA court hearing documents as the evidence.

@aarontaylor03 the ‘69’ reasons cracked us all up at #superpod6. Ingrid Visser, one of the worlds best marine biologists found it hilarious. Where the fu*k did they come up with that number?!!. 😂

@theneonrunner 🤣😂🤣 he doesn’t even know you exist...
Wow fery good
@i.am.meha I clicked on you link when I saw the stupidness you were writing on everyone’s comments. Your little motto “always be thankful. Always help others. Always think positively. This love others. And know you are loved and Jesus loves you.” Are you sure Jesus loves you, you Troll?
@riptide42 that troll @i.am.meha is literally commenting that nonsense on everyone’s comments who are disgusted by this photo. She’s clearly a complete nutter. What a sad life she must live.
@ronnelott I use the shit by the keg
@missmorganwalker yes He does but I don’t judge others on their decisions. If that’s what he wants to do, then that’s what he does.
@missmorganwalker nope not nutter, I just don’t judge people on the way they live their lives.
@riptide42 Not sure what aquariums you are referring to, but I do know the one in Atlanta does so much for marine life and cares for those animals. I have been several times and have enjoyed it. I guess we can all do what we want to do. You do you by not going and I will do me by going. 🤷🏾‍♀️
@bluewhitevegan it would make sense for you to be pro animal. That’s the point.
😡👎🏻
@moving.animals maybe try to stop judging him for what he does. If you don’t like it, then don’t follow him or watch his movies. Problem solved.
why are y'all getting so booty tickled for 🤦🏽‍♂️
Why are you promoting this I thought you are intelligent!?Those animals dont belong there!!!!!
@dollfin74 I’m glad it gave you a good laugh. Continue to live in ignorance. You and your special #superpod6. Our so called marine biologist hasn’t even seen the list. Visser has no clue. The credentials are irrelevant.
So beautiful
@dean_woodford uhhh never
@the_vegan_goddess it really is, but hey, you watched a documentary, it must be true, right?
@aarontaylor03 hey you're talking out of your a** it must be true right 😆
@the_vegan_goddess not when I have shit to prove it
hay cosas que el dinero no puede com prar y creo que tu lo has entendido muy bien, estar cerca de la naturaleza y poderla apreciar es un sentimiento unico.
You look so happy. God bless you. Make thoughts memories.
Amazing!!!!!
💗💗💗
💗💗💗
@riptide42 also they do a great deal for wildlife preservation and the education of children. It’s more than keeping these animals in captivity. You must be a vegan right?!? How do you feel about the slaughter of cows and chickens for consumption?!?
@brennamin_  Yeah I’m aware of the good work they have done rehoming certain species. I was trying to point out that their goals aren’t as black & white as it appears on the surface. The Russia deal has massively tainted whatever good work they did/are doing in my eyes. I’m not trying to spread false information at all, just trying to draw attention to the way that most cetaceans are captured for the likes of Seaworld etc.
@mortgagemuscle
@theneonrunner not upset. Just curious. I sent the same thing to all you finger pointers. how are you judging what's going on in the photo ? From The Rock's point of view it's of Love. He has no idea what goes on in the dark. The dark is exactly what you should be judging. The darkness what I speak of is the poor mistreatment of these animals. That is why you attack the source.
"Not funny! Terrible! Beautiful beluga must be in the wild. 
You have global voice but wrong platform."
@neel.pradeep you says these things yet they have been designed to survive. There are places where Dogs run free and wild like in Mexico for instance. Same as Cats. In The u.s. there are places where cat packs run free. Therefore your statement is wrong. All of the Animals of The Earth have been given the abilities to survive in the wild.
Anyone who doesn’t like the photo move on. Geeeez.  I don’t like them in captivity either but to each is own. Don’t try to put your beliefs on anyone else. Maybe he doesn’t see it the way you do. I don’t get why people feel he NEED to comment negatively. It’s his page. Do what the fuck u want Johnson Family!
@the_duke_of_earl92 I don't know who you think you're kidding, but I can guarantee Dwayne Johnson does not think this animal loves him. It has clearly been trained for entertainment purposes. No need to speculate about "the dark" when the mistreatment is going on in the light as depicted.

You know better than this. It is not ok to keep animals captive

This is wrong @therock , very very sad 😢
@veganmagick Blackfish is full of lies, deceit, and propaganda!! It’s utterly shameful that they created that in the way that they did.
@if6woz9 Seaworld does more to rescue injured or stranded animals than you know. They are not similar.
I love the way you get involved with the animals and people.  You have such a wonderful life! You are such a wonderful person,  I thank GOD for creating a special Rock, YOU.
@wrigleylindav I want to thank you for calling out other countries on capturing these animals. It’s illegal in the US to do this since 1972, but as you stated, other countries are shamelessly doing this.
واقعا خوشحالم چندروزی میشه با پیج شما آشنا شدم واقعا پست های خوبی می زارید 😊😊😊😊☺😃 لطفا به پیج ما هم سر بزنید
#thanksbutnotanks
@krislawr Don’t bring Seaworld into this. Also, it’s not akin to humans living in a bathtub.
@dollfin74 Blackfish is full of lies, deceit, and propaganda. It’s downright shameful. You can against captivity all you want, but #Blackfish is bullshit.
Sooo Stupid.
@aarontaylor03 seriously. People are ridiculous. I was just bummed to find out he was there 2 days before me (even though I'm sure it was after hours or something and he had the place to himself lol) I would've been just as excited to see the Rock as I was to see the whale sharks lol
@misscrisp77 Seaworld isn’t cruel to their Orcas. Secondly, they haven’t captured an orca from the wild in over 40 years. The rest were born in captivity. They cannot be set in the wild. The last time people did that, the orca from the movie Free Willy died a slow, horrible death of starvation and pneumonia. It didn’t know how to hunt. Other pods rejected him. Look it up if you don’t believe me. Seaworld rescues animals more than you could ever know.
Super😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
"@lilian_pumpernickle - they are “trained” - food deprivation -
to perform tricks and “look happy.”"
@aarontaylor03 Yes! russia, china and Japan are moving backwards compared to the US when it comes to animal exploitation. Its a real shame. Seems like any progress we gain here is small because of the work still needed to be done over seas. But awareness is growing!
It’s so sad to see these beautiful animals being tortured. It’s heartless
@karalucasphotography -haaaah!  The animals are not forced?  Because he checked himself in to the aquarium?  And explained to his “caretakers” that he would rather not eat until he gets all those tricks right! You figured it out!  All animals in a zoo or aquarium are there by choice!  And all humans in prison are there by choice!
@monicayoungson Blackfish is full of lies, deceit, and propaganda!! It’s utterly shameful what they did.
@i.am.meha - I am a vegan - what’s your point?
oh dear.. another petty vegan. Animals at all AZA facilities give their animals food through out the day without singalong to do any behaviors. You can’t force an animal who’s larger than you to do anything.
It’s so sad to see these beautiful animals being tortured. It’s heartless
@i.am.meha - they are not well cared for;  they are deprived of food to perform tricks, they are kept in tanks that are woefully too small and display psychological reactions to inactivity .  Other than that, well cared for.
@lay_papi - he won’t, we won’t.  Well thought our comment.
@rebecca_b_land Name something... nearly the entire thing isn’t factual, or it’s grossly misleading.  That entire “documentary” is a disgrace.
@mlgcroc - by definition, yes, it does.
@the_vegan_goddess Blackfish is full of lies, deceit, and propaganda!! It’s a disgrace to anyone who makes factual documentaries.
@paththewordsmith - goodness - assume much?
@i.am.meha So you think they are here on this planet for your entertainment?  That’s sad.  They are living, feeling, beings with families that stay together their entire lives.  If you aren’t going to go out of your way to see them in the wild, then you really don’t deserve to see them at all.  You’re supporting a slave trade.  That is not kindness.  That is not positivity.  That’s cruelty.
@wrigleylindav agreed it is growing. These countries need to have pressure put on them. However, I just want to say that Blackfish is full of lies, deceit, and propaganda. It also directs anger towards Seaworld instead of where anger should be which is what you just mentioned.
@parked this is my Dream...make it happen
Ya people are stupid. Let him be with his family
Wow. Let him be for goodness sakes!!! He is out doing stuff with his famiky like most of us have or are!!! Fricken ey!!!
You suck
Rejoignez les bilies
rock usaobu Delfinariju ima li nas
Do not promote this!!! Animals in captivity are slaves and are dying of their conditions. Shame on you @therock for promoting this!
Way to exploit animal cruelty... So sad. You realize where this animals live and how they are treated? This whale did not sign up for this. You should do better.. 👎😠
...which should be free. Not cool rock.
@i.am.meha “Always be Thankful.  Always help others.  Always be positive.” That is what you say on your Instagram, but it’s not how you’re behaving.  To answer your questions, I care and it’s not only his life.  There are TWO lives in this photo and both should be able to enjoy their days with their families.  One cannot because it was stolen from its family and tortured until it learned to perform for people.  You are a Christian.  Live like one and show compassion for the abused and be a voice for the voiceless.  I think Dwayne is a good man who made a mistake.  He could do wonders in movement the free sentient beings from prisons like this.  Instead, he is promoting their enslavement.  That’s a very sad thing.  And some aquariums are awesome.  This one is not.  Be well. Be kind. And please remember to always help others.
Beautiful bald heads @therock

😊😊👌👌
Sooo cute😍❤
@if6woz9 Nice try, but this isn’t true. While the Georgia Aquarium did have dealings with Russia to import 18 wild-caught belugas to expand their pod, the permit was denied by the U.S. government. I believe the aquarium’s actions here were wrong, as I am 100% against wild capture of cetaceans, but you are spreading false information. Many of the animals on display at the Georgia Aquarium are rescues, and others were purchased from other parks around the country.
Cool
Wow bruh, looks like your catching some serious heat on this.  Dont let bother you. These people seem to think its your fault these creatures are being held captive.  I say fuck em and keep doing what you're doing. All i see is man being a good dad hanging out with his kid and his woman. No harm in that.
@sublime76 so cause the most harm possible and exploit animals if you're not 100% off the grid?  All or nothing.  Every day items and high fiving a beluga whale at a zoo and encouraging hundreds of thousands of fans to pay to exploit animals in captivity is not even close to the same.
All the nice things he does,he does one bad thing,and people are like "Oh wow what a bad person I'm unfollowing".Jesus people, everyone makes mistakes,don't tell me you've never been to a fucking zoo,so please just shut the hell up.
@shriya_saran1109 Bich he’s just taking a picture
This was photoshop...
I totally disagree with keeping an animal of any species locked up its cruel and disgusting, but i forget where but there is this zoo ive herd of that takes only animals with deformations, or a problem that would make it hard for them to survive in the wild, and they take them in fix up the animal best they can and teach them, then trys to release them back into the wild, other then that zoos and aquariums are a prison camp for animals.
@mynameisshafa ihy
@zuhazaiid ilym
Sad you did this the rock. Damn you was almost perfect...but you human so make amends
Cute
You all need to fuking chill. Its not like they take animals out of the wild and throw them in here. they take animals that CANT survive in the wild and help them. They're fed, loved, and happy. Id rather have them in captivity then dead in the ocean. Id rather have a species survive then killed off. All of the haters out there are fucking children. Grow up and do some research before you go around making a mess of everything.
Please dont support animals in captivity
👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼wrong wrong dont support captivity
cuki :)
@lewishamilton @therock how can you be okay with this? Is it pure ignorance or lack of compassion. Think for one second the tragic journey this magnificent creature had to endure to end up in captivity for our entertainment and to make money. This soul belongs in the ocean, free as nature intended.
@therock Educate yourself for fucks sake!! This creature belongs in the ocean not in captivity. How on this earth can you be ok with promoting and supporting this?
🤬 you need to fire the press agent who thought depicting machismo intended violence against a aquarium prisoner would garner a positive reaction from your more enlightened fan base . What a dick move. 🤬
Osm
@shriya_saran1109 theres no polution in the aquarium water unlike the ocean the animal came from
Hermoso
This beautiful whale belongs in its natural habitat Dwayne???? Baddddd move dude!!!!
Wow!!! Cute ❤️😮

@moving.animals I’m annoyed at how you people are trying to tell him what he should do.

@riptide42 I love aquariums and zoos and probably won’t stop going. I am not going to the wild to see these creatures and that is why they are there and they are well taken care of too.

This beautiful creature should be in the ocean! Shame on you @therock for promoting this. Slavery in any form is wrong. 😥
STOP &THINK before you post ,this is an Albino Manatee if it wasnt here where its safe ,it would be the ultimate prize for a poacher!!!
@lilbug56 this is actually a beluga whale, which are also best kept sae so they can breed as they are also a threatened species
So cool lucky😮
Beautiful looking

No these animals should be where they belong in the ocean with their pods
Dick move! #emptythetanks
@zombienow skkkkkkrrrt bich, they should leave animals in their natural habitats, PERIOD.
@ug1i that’s what I’m saying m8, read the guys comment that I replied to😂
@zombienow wow I am so sorry, I’m an asshole 😭💀
🐳🐳🤩🤩
@ug1i don’t worry about it😂
😍
You two are like each other. Big, strong, and reaching each other with friendship.
@therock 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Despite the beauty and intelligence of the Beluga, it belongs in the ocean, not the aquarium, @therock you know this right?
Co-star? This isn't an actor @therock. This is an animal that deserves to be in the wild or placed in a  sanctuary. Not cool that you would glorify captivity.
i can't imagine that you managed to get a photo with me, the real ian warthog, as i flop in the water @therealianwillies
@riptide42 stfu
@veganmagick for the love of god. Blackfish was a fucking lie. NONE of what was in the the movie was actually true. So learn the facts before u start talking nonsense
@theneonrunner BYE👋
😍😍😍😘😍😍❤️😘😍😍
You should really educate yourself prior to making decisions like working with a captivated animal.
Disgraceful! This animal has been imprisoned and is living it's life in a chlorine filled tank. Think about that for a moment. You havd just promoted the abuse & mistreatment of animals to millions of followers. Disgusting
@therock Paul would be proud of what u have done in life
Nice
♡♡♡♡♡
Love it
🐋🐋🐋❤️ nice
Uau uau🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳
Wowww...I love Beluga Whales that's so awesome!!! Is the Beluga giving you a pound ...😂😂😂 👏

Белуха класная
Don't encourage animals being kept in captivity
What the fuck! Animals are not ours to use.
Is it reality sir
I admire you a lot. I believe you are a great human being, this photo made me doubt about that. I liked the photo just because of you but I actually don’t like the fact that you are promoting and supporting this type of places. Animals are capture to be a property of these places and entertain humans like you. Humans that think they respect and love animals. I personally think that going to places like #GeorgiaAquarium is definitely not sign of  love and respect for the animals. I hope one day you realize what you really did posting this picture on your page. @therock
@theneonrunner wow good riddance snowflake!!
@therock  BiG Show
The animals here are safe and are not being put in harms way. Yeah lets put them in the ocean where they can get harmed or killed, at least in here they have a chance.
#Good luck @fekry1410 ⠀‏
@ultra.stank this whale was captured from the wild, it know how to hunt and survive and the whales pod is being tracked. Do research before you commenr
@marco.gag this whale was captured from the wild and was fully healthy, you’re the one making assumptions
@zombienow And you know that how?
@shriya_saran1109 wow you are lame. How about you go free them?!? Geez. I love watching the animals in captivity. It’s so awesome.
@riptide42 who cares it’s his life and aquariums are awesome.
@iamdon25 you can track down the whale starting at the aquarium. Doesn’t take long but eventually you can figure out how every whale is captured
@glaucialolli too late I love that they are in captivity and will continue to pay money to watch them in a cage.
@veganmagick I love that they are in captivity and will continue to pay money to watch them in a cage.
@theneonrunner bye Felicia
You are awesome and eff the people who feel otherwise. I am sure they are wearing clothes and eating food of dead animals.
@if6woz9 🙄
@scottishbird75 🙄
@ug1i 🙄
@if6woz9 🙄
🙄 so what
@kala_dacaptain we weren't discussing the beluga whales, we were talking about the whale sharks
@the_duke_of_earl92 I could ask the same thing, why are you so upset over an Instagram comment? I do not support using wildlife as entertainment, period. I think it is sick and sad. I don't know why you would bring my nonexistent pets into the picture and then change the topic, but how I feel is very straightforward. I am not judging anything that goes on "in the dark," I am judging exactly what is going on in this photo, nothing more and nothing less.
@zacheryel That discussion which I started is about every single animal in that aquarium.
Great
I’m in awe too! LOL
Moron
#emptythetanks
#EMPTYTHETANKS. Do not promote this horror which is captivity. Think of how these animals are captured! How they're ripped from their families and starved till they learn tricks and spend their shortened life in a fish bowl.
Beautiful
😍😍😎😎😘
@therock We would like to post a great comment but cant decide if captive animals are good or bad. Scientific brain says one thing and emotions state another. I am pretty sure no one is right or wrong. These places open minds of next generation but is also cruel if these animals are not treated well....
@joshuadesimone 😂😂😂😂😂
@kala_dacaptain I  agree. All animals should be free, but I was having a discussion with @i.lyon about how the Georgia Aquarium acquired the whale sharks.
👏😂
Everyone shut the hell up!
@arefghafouri beautifully put👏👏🌱🌱
@paththewordsmith Actually that’s false.  I have posted about children in cages, and Instagram isn’t the only form of social networking.  If you were to look at my Facebook page you’d see plenty about racial inequality.  I don’t have any cages for my two rescue dogs, and the rest of the dogs you see are looking for loving homes.  Ignorance is a choice.  Be a better person.
@therock thats not nice punshing the poor thing lol
This is absolutely disgusting they don't belong in captivity please do some research before you support such abuse
@theneonrunner cool story, Dwayne and his 112 million other followers won't miss you.
@hircome lol I won't miss them either. Fair trade!
@glaucialolli they are both animals just like your uneducated ass
Dude really? Ur promoting the capture of wild creatures who belong in the ocean and not in captivity for our own amusement! Come on you can do better than this. How much more awesome would this have been if it chose to come see you in the wild? Please mate, use your celeb power for good and to educate your fans this is NOT what we should be doing. Much respect 🙏🏼
😍
Not cool. 💔
@mlgcroc Watch a documentary called Born to be Free. See how you feel about the Georgia Aquarium after that. They are heartless and cruel. Many Belugas are held up in Russia because Georgia Aquarium 'ordered " them. Once they were caught their permits were then denied so now they are held captive over in a real shit hole in Russia. Numerous Belugas are in shallow pools and all they do all day is swim in circles all day and bob up and down. This is no " Blackfish " . These are hardcore facts and video footage. Put your money where your mouth is.
@therock I’m truly a fan but very much not a fan of this pic and your endorsement and promotion of that baby in captivity. That beautiful creature you’re in awe of is an animal that has been imprisoned and is exploited every day of its life... the #GeorgiaAquarium makes money off of horrific exploitation of these creatures—stealing wild animals, or exploiting imprisoned animals and turning the females into breeding factories. These gorgeous animals deserve better. So if you really care about them, the way you claim, you would denounce such exploitation and promote organizations who fight for these animals to remain free. You’re quite a star. Please think of what it would feel like to live in these animals worlds, and then use your stardom to promote good. Not evil exploitation and cruelty like the #GeorgiaAquarium
Que hermoso
@kitteeex4 it’s not the aquarium itself that conserves it’s the money they make that goes into conservation efforts or funding groups
Oooooooooooooooo - bailey from finding dory
They need good exhibits to draw attention to make money and some of that goes towards conservation and breeding programs a huge part lines the pockets of corporate a**holes but thankfully The small percent that goes to the right think is still a lot of money that normal people wouldnt have put towards the efforts
@kitteeex4 doesn't mean every aquarium is heartless and cruel
If you’re in so much awe of these beautiful and magnificent creatures, then why are you condoning the seclusion and capture of these amazing, sentient beings as you post this photo? Their life is confinement and working as a slave for humans. They do the trick, they get food. They become depressed in these small water bowls because they are not in their natural habitat. Many of which have even drowned themselves. I say screw the aquariums just as much as I say screw sea world. You have such a huge following. Use your power to show the world that THIS IS NOT OKAY. As far as I’m concerned, slavery was never abolished as long as this continues to happen. @therock
wow!!
Gorgeous animal! Thank you for sharing your encounter with us and supporting accredited places like Georgia Aquarium!
That is so cute
Looks like you
This is disappointing 😢 to say the least
Wow
@n0fvtvr3 fack
#f4f #f4follow #TBT #followme
That is awesome
My daughter tried to explain to me that there are two types of “hot”, the kind when it is hot outside, and the type that she compared to “Join Johnson” as she calls you. My 7 year old will literally watch any movie you’re in. Jumanji is our fave!!!
Idiot!
Amazing😍
@the_duke_of_earl92 Pets like cats and dogs do not belong in the wild. They have been domesticated for the last 15000 years.
@ellispeteellis like you've never been in the zoo
What beauty, never touch a dolphin😭😭 that envies, but heals😂
Its about time your followers grew up and just let you be a dad and live your life.  They all have something negative to say until they do it themselves.  Love ya dude.
@jasonbolalek agreed on that. But many aquariums rehab and release hundreds of animals every year. Many animals in captivity were rescued and are even considered “non-releasable. “ it’s not a perfect system but the majority of these places are filled with people who love and care for these animals and the money generated by aquariums is of great help. They aren’t getting that significant funding from anywhere else.
Yall crying about it should be out in the wild but it’s hunters who kill them for sport , to showcase ... If yall feel so deep about the animals go break them out and return them .. if not stfu and enjoy the show ..
@paththewordsmith How does speaking out for one group of exploited beings mean that someone doesn’t speak out for other exploited beings?  Is your heart so small that you can’t care about BOTH racism and animal exploitation.  This whale was not rescued.  This whale was either stolen from its family in the ocean, or its mother was stolen from her family in the ocean, then raped and then had her child stolen from her.  It’s insanely cruel, unethical and should not be embraced by someone like The Rock - who has an incredible voice to do good rather than support this evil business. It’s a slave trade.  Maybe you aren’t aware of how it works, but it’s not what you described above.  Speak up to all abused of power and greed, not just the issues that only affect you.
@riptide42 because he took his family out and he can do whatever the hell he wants? Get off his nuts dude if you hate it so much then go out and protest the place, aquariums and zoos aren’t the reason why animals go extinct it’s our fellow man that kills off tons of animals, and these places can and lend a hand at helping keep certain species around.
@glaucialolli Free your pets, Sister.
@rotaryfanatic I’m sorry but you’re either clueless, or you choose to be complicit in supporting this slave trade.  Extinction and exploitation aren’t the same things.  Species preservation and training/torturing animals to perform for human entertainment and profit aren’t the same things.  Educate yourself and be a better person.
@riptide42 Free your pets (slaves), Brother.
@ethically_elizabeth Free your pets (slaves), Sister

Pobre animalito 😢
@the_duke_of_earl92 They aren’t my pets.  They don’t work for me or entertain others for my profit.  They are rescued from horrible situations and share my home.  I’m their slave.  So why are you defending and supporting and promoting the slavery of beings that rival your own intelligence level?  Have you learned nothing from history?  Or are you just repeating what you were taught, rather than questioning those who abuse power and exploit others for profit?
Awesome 👌♥️
@the_duke_of_earl92 what pets?
@haulinboats Their rehab and release programs don’t excuse taking wild animals and enslaving them to lives in pools. GA, SeaWorld and other sea parks generate millions in ticket sales annually, not including the millions of dollars they make in pedaling unhealthy food and beverages each year to kids. These parks don’t exploit animals to fund their rehab programs. They have those programs to try to make up for the abuse they perpetuate. There are plenty of reputable sanctuaries and wildlife rehab centers that exist without exploiting animals. I’m a volunteer at a local facility in South Florida. People love supporting the amazing work we do, because we have integrity and don’t compromise the lives of some animals to save others. These marine parks exist to make money, not to save the future of our oceans. If that were the case, they would stop taking animals from the wild and contributing to declining global populations. They would also stop supporting the industries most responsible for habitat loss, species extinction, water pollution and ocean dead zones (animal agriculture and commercial fishing). I understand that you want to believe their carefully crafted campaigns about how much they care about the animals there, because you love animals. However, I encourage you to look a bit deeper and see these facilities for what they truly are, money hungry corporations. Please watch Blackfish and The Cove and read about the psychological distress endured by animals in captivity. Check out the term “zoochosis”. ✌🏼
@therock don’t become captivated by captivity. There is no beauty in stolen freedom. It’s sad that you’re promoting this 😔 #GeorgiaAquarium
@riptide42 Aren't you the one exploiting?  If the animals aren't in their natural habitat by your standards they are enslaved ? Right ? You're not letting nature take it's course. The circle of life is cruel but it's Fact. Your "rescuing" is enslavement. Like you said their intelligence level rivals ours (including yours), right ? So what are you doing ? Are you actually rescuing by your standards. Isn't "Rescue" a word that gets thrown around a ton by organizations ? I'm not discouraging you. I'm just trying to get you finger pointers to see how hypocritical you all sound. Your words contradict. The man just saw it as Family day and bonding with creatures. You humans these days are fast to what they call crucify others without any knowledge at all whatsoever. All of humanity needs to get it together. I'm all for the Love of Animals. The Rock had no idea of the background you all assume he does which is why you all are triggered. If you all had 💙 and compassion for your fellow Human you'd see he meant Love by it without knowing what goes on in the dark.
@ethically_elizabeth 100 percent correct. The Georgia Aquarium is anything but ethical.
@the_duke_of_earl92 So much BS in what you just wrote.  Be an honest man.  It’s not that difficult.  Watch Blackfish.  Watch The Cove.  Understand the insane intelligence of these whales.  Understand how their familial pods exist.  Understand their plight and suffering.  Stop trying to justify bad behavior and trying make a false equivalency that is nonsense.  That’s not what honest people do.
@theneonrunner you have no pets ? If so, CONGRATULATIONS! Good on ya! You're not a hypocrite like the rest. With that aside.. Why are you all upset over a man that only saw it as Family time and bonding with other creatures without the knowledge of what goes on in the dark ? You are all quick to what they call crucify without getting all the facts. What right is that ? You all don't like to judge yet you all judge a man that has no idea what goes on in the dark. How would you all feel if the roles were reversed ?
@the_duke_of_earl92 *be judged
@haulinboats Non releasable animals belong in sanctuaries. If it’s not an official sanctuary it’s not ethical. Sanctuaries are non profit and all moneys go to research and conservation. Aquariums can’t say the same, they use profits toward more captive animals, sustain cetacean and human interaction, organize vegas style trick shows and worst of all invest in breeding programs to keep their tanks full. This is a fact. No matter how much their trainers love them it’s a corrupt corporatized system.
@therock I am a big fan of yours upto this point but seriously. Some jobs you should just turn down. Use your power for good. Use the money from this film to Reabillitate this magnificent creature.
Sign um up!!! Beautiful is right!!!
🙏🏻
@riptide42 BS ? Or are you just a hypocrite and you're in denial ? I just spoke to a non-hypocrite who has no pets. Sounds as if she believes in nature and the circle of life. You are all of what you just typed, man. Be honest with yourself. If you read all of what I typed you'd clearly see I said that The Rock has no idea what goes on in the dark. I wouldn't call it dark if I was trying to justify bad behavior....... I've known how intelligent all creatures are from growing up. Humans are declining which is clearly plain to see. I still have to Love you all though.
😍😍😍😍👍
@jasonbolalek 🙌🏼
#stopanimalcruelty #emptythetanks
😥 this is awful.
All of you ar trying to shame @therock because of his pictures, leave the man alone, these animals are fine, and the reason this animals might not survive is because of humanity, they are better off there than in our polluted oceans, because all of you are dirty and polluted
UR LIT!! Can I ask something? How many shows and movies have you been in?
@the_duke_of_earl92 Why do you assume that Dwayne doesn’t know how whales are captured and traded?  He’s a worldly man, and I would be shocked if he was unaware of the films I recommended to you.  You can’t say you choose love, then defend abuse and slavery.  You are either love or your aren’t.  Live up to your potential and speak out for the voiceless.  Giving a domesticated, abandoned life a safe place to live is not the same as stealing a free animal from its family and forcing it to perform for your profit.  These false equivalencies empower the slave traders.  It’s unfortunate that’s the path you’ve chosen, but that path is not the love you speak of.  As Maya Angelou said, “when you know better, you do better.”
@sublime76 Don't you know the difference between wildlife and pets? Do some research.
@riptide42 I do not recall choosing abuse and slavery. Which is why I call it dark. You all have to keep in mind that though he is a celebrity he is also Human. Not all Humans know the actual facts of what goes on in the dark. I've been one with The MILLIONS and Millions ever since I was a kid. From all the stuff I've seen and read, The Rock Loves Animals and if he actually knew what goes on he wouldn't support it.
@the_duke_of_earl92 Go to watch the documentary "Blackfish" and get informed. You should know tge difference between wildlife and pets otherwise do some research.
@the_duke_of_earl92 Perhaps he doesn’t know what happens in the dark.  But, I bet he knows now!  I have no hard feelings towards him, and admire so much about him.  I just want him to be more conscious of the suffering of others.  As do you it seems.  Wishing you the best, and appreciate the dialog.
Why ronaldo it's here?😉
Goorg 😂👌
@zacheryel that’s definitely a trick
@glaucialolli I do believe research is intended for you. You see I've been informed since childhood of the cruelties of humanity toward Animals. Don't all pets originate from the Wild ? They were given all the things they need to survive. I just wanted the ones of you who own pets to know how hypocritical you all sound. You didn't insult anybody you commented in a way that was informal which I commend.
Amazing
@theellenshow
@theellenshow
Everyone needs to get over it and get a life seriously. I hope yall was this worried when your chomping on your Chipotles and KFC chicken or your Fish Filets.so what!! i love you and support you Dwayne forget the Haterz.
Hi
Don’t support animal captivity!!!!
My dad loves you shows and he loves you he thinks you are amazing
@ginger_issh yup 😞. I didn’t like it for very obvious reasons. Not cool 😔
That is such a beautiful whale 😢
Haha!
Oh my god will you fucking animal rights activists shut the fuck up already. He’s out with his family enjoying the aquarium and you fucks are belittling him like he’s the one going out and capturing these animals. Shut the fuck up and get a life.
This is so sad :(
yes you know 🐳
All you people talking shit about this need to stfu. Have you ever gone to a zoo? Yes now get a life
@wrigleylindav can you stfu. You make a stand. God this world is cancer
Posing with an incarcerated prisoner.
@shriya_saran1109 Shut up!
@ethically_elizabeth Shut up!
@crystalhefner i eat meat for living! Stfu!
@if6woz9 maybe u should stfu
@brandondenniston523 ignorant comment from a person UNEDUCATED about this. Bye Felicia 😂😂💁👋👋
@nick.king.3386 but u eat meat for living! So stfu
Awesome ! After watching Baywatch all I can think if it the last speech you gave to the villain before she blew up . (I am the sea!) And also Maui .haha I'm glad y'all had fun .
@wrigleylindav so you never went to a zoo? I can assure you i'm educated. That the best you got? Celebs cant do anything without people like you. Stfu keyboard warrior. You make a stand a get up off your ass
@therock go read @domzthompson 🌿💪
@therock imagine your life in a bathtub 24/7.
:D
A bit of a contradiction these comments. The animals are safe and get free medical here . It's not like they horde more than they can care for . Of course if you've seen the sea Sheppard's you know that there is a greater evil of them being hunted at sea. Let the man enjoy time with his family in peace . And for real you wanna compare this to slavery? I think the man knows his history.
👎👎👎👎👎
@brandondenniston523 I DONT go to zoos or aquariums anymore, I did when i was IGNORANT and didn't know any better. Giving them any money supports the business.  I research and read many biologists work. I read scientific papers about marine life for fun in my spare time. I give money to the proper marine conservation institutions and NOT places like the Georgia Aquarium. If my comment angers you. You could simply bypass it. Yet here you are calling ME a keyboard warrior. Celebrities are role models and depend on their fans to stay relevant and prosperous. The rock has every right to know who he is disappointing. I could give a flying fuck if you care because you are no one. And you have 0 influence on Instagram.
@wrigleylindav you are no one too😂. So i guess you live on istagram? So people cant enjoy themselves or live THEIR life. Guessing youre a vegan. Love how you think youre someone because you have followers?If you dont care why do you keep replying? Go ahead reply again. Feed me with your energy.
@wrigleylindav haha you do know when you block someone....They win? Cant take the heat get the eff out of my kitchen.
This is an intelligent sentient whale, one that should not be held in captivity. @therock you have a massive platform...use it to educate! #emptythetanks
@therock u r one of my favorite people on the planet, please educate yourself on these beautiful  beluga whales! Not good that they r in captivity! They belong in the wild!
And don’t support the @georgiaaquarium @therock
Not only is having whales in captivity generally bad for the animals, but this specific aquarium is known for having terrible animal welfare as well
lisxheidiNot only is having whales in captivity generally bad for the animals, but this specific aquarium is known for having terrible animal welfare as well 😭! Please don't support this!
I’m sorry you are getting so much hate for supporting zoos and aquariums. Thank you for posting this! ❤️
Nooo!
Shame on you
This is not natural
😢 this animal should be in wild
How can you even make a post like this! Admiring their beauty while supporting their captivity. This is disgusting.
Dude, everyone has been to a zoo.  You shouldnt be slammed for it.  It's nice you have an appreciation of animals.  Some people dont understand that animals have been born in captivity or are abused amimals who have never known peace until they get to a zoo.  And im sure no one has any clue what goes behind the scenes of a zoo.  Volunteer workers helping feed, clean, and giving some type of affection to these animals.
don’t support animals in captivity!! it’s cruel and unnatural
I am your biggest fan😃
@therock shame on you
@goodmorningamerica obsessed...... with animal cruelty?
@lolaspooks really though
@therock I respect you so much and love you but THIS is not okay 🙁! This poor creature should be free and you shouldn't be promoting places that keep animals in captivity to entertain people, it’s wrong😢. I loved your interview with @iamjamiefoxx where you were saying « it’s nice to be important but it’s more important to be nice ».In my opinion, this should apply to all species! Please continue to pass the right messages 🙏🏼
@kurtain_rod
Niečo, úžasné..
@theneonrunner used for entertainment and also fed well while they might not survive in the wild considering they were either born in captivity or there since they were babies so they dont have a skill to survive out there. Why are you people acting as if these animals were abused and hunted for fun?
IF YOUR A FAN OF RAP FOLLOW MY ACCOUNT 💎💎🔥🚀🚀🚀
I’m guessing that’s real!!
☹️👎🏽
🤣🤣🤣🔥
Very disappointed. You are indirectly supporting this cruelty.
Just another celebrity supporting this 👎 get real @amandacerny
So disappointed 😪 you should not be supporting this type of cruelty! These intelligent creatures deserve to be free
Animals like these help so many people with problems. Dolphin therapy is often the only way to help for many people. These animals are treated well. Dwayne Johnson is a good person who visit only animals who have a good life. This gives attention to the fact that spending time with one's own family as well as spending time with such animals can make every people heartly to smile. not everyone animal is bad in captivity. so, we are all prisoners of our everyday life. and these animals in freedom do have much more enemies and dangers, one should also think about that before convicting anyone.✨ have a nice day @therock #georgiaaquarium
You’re a real animal abuser. Shame on you. I can’t wait for the day for you to man up and have a proper conversation with @domzthompson about your seemingly never ending list of how you support animal abuse in the meat, egg, diary and entertainment industry. Shame on you #animal abuser #animal abuse #therockisananimalabuser #animalprison
Massive fan of your posts, but #epicfail here! 😞🙈
NO!!! Exactly they’re intelligent and should be put in a swimming pool!!! Disgraceful that you’ve shared and supported this cruelty 😡
@skylerspring
They aren't supposed to be in captivity, please don't promote this on your Instagram it's awful!!
#unfollow
What about you dickheads that own dogs / cats and goldfish . Stfu
😡👎😡
So many idiots commenting on this picture. This is an AQUARIUM not Sea World. These facilities are built to help rehabilitate the animals that they can, and offer a safe place for those animals that can not be sent back into the ocean. Do some research morons! Good on you @therock for supporting an amazing place a this
@arefghafouri well obviously he isn’t full of empathy as he doesn’t take any notice of how the animals are being treated
Nnnnoooo! Captivity is cruel, please use you notoriety to tell people that it is wrong, animals weren’t put I this planet for human entertainment. The ONLY place they belong is in the ocean wild and free. @therock please watch “The Cove” and “Blackfish “ documentaries and help educate people on how cruel and wrong this.😓
@ijustine no! This isn’t cute it’s cruel! #captivitykills #seaworldsucks #endcaptivity
@theegilp não são como golfinhos... mas também é AMOROSA imagina.... AMOROSA MESMO
Is that an animal in a enclosure, if so you shouldn't be supporting that in my opinion... Just saying
@domzthompson 👈☝🏽Knows what's up... these animals are being captured just to create a show and revenue and clearly a stupid movie.  I thought we knew better than this but clearly not yet. C'mon guys!!!!
@vegan_floridian @themadblaxican Seriously does this whale look like it needs rehabbing?  @
@themadblaxican @domzthompson
@aysnr1907
I love you...
Disgusting.
@the_vegan_goddess 100%
@vegan_floridian we don’t know if it has any health conditions that prevent it from successfully being reintroduced into the wild
Cetatains don't belong in captivity been forced to perform for the entertainment of people😢
@if6woz9 What ? It’s a fact, the company most likely is making a ton of money and there is still a lot of support for the service. Also why tf you looking at my profile 😂 creepy as shit.
So sad he is stuck in there. Should be thriving in the ocean🌊
I saw a documentary about the capture and fatality rate in captivity.  They are beautiful and yes i would be the same as you and marvel at these wonderful creatures but i have seen the damage it is doing to these whales.  X
Come on man! Do better than this! Shame on you.
@squillalily totally disappointing that @therock would support this
This is fucked @nicmaylee have you seen this 😭😭😭
No
👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿
Not right at all
So sad @therock that you think this is ok💔😔Please don’t do this!!! #sayno2captivity #captivitykills
I'm taking my kids to the zoo twice as much as normal just to spite the douche bag haters.
😂😂😂😂😂😂@angelsaloha
??@_lemar_noble
@therock you are way too famous to be promoting animals in captivity. Wake the fuck up man. Do you think that Beluga whale wants to be there ready to be your “co-star” or it would rather be swimming free in the ocean?? Just give it a thought please.
💔
🙏🏻❤️
@orsyka46 bullshit do some research before crying these aquariums do alot for conservation
😑😑😑. When you see one of your heroes support the enslavement of innocent creatures for entertainment. A sad day.
😢😢😢😢
Lol love all these self appointed disciples for animal rights posting on Instagram better get off all these server farms taking up space animals could live in  and the electricity they consume destroys air and water the animals could enjoy smh
Awsome🐋🐋
But why you Don‘t support this animal in his rights to be free in his Home the ocean? This is realy sad 😞 @therock
@shriya_saran1109 please go do something about it other than talking all this dumb fucking shit. Go DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!!!
How sad! This poor beautiful creature does NOT belong in captivity!!!
Stre rock no1
What a shame, though, that this whale is a prisoner and slave for entertainment purposes 😢🐋 #onelove 💚✌🏼
@shriya_saran1109 thank you for bringing attention to this 🤗🙏🏼🌈
@shriya_saran1109  ok since you’re  so against “enslaving” animals then. Don’t own a dog,cat horse or even a damn fish ✌🏻
#samebarber
You praise the animal, yet you pretend like it’s not in a prison ? Lost so much respect for you
@therock please reconsider this image for a moment. This animal is enslaved and imprisoned so people can gawk at him and so that CEO’s can get paid fat bucks for movie appearances. This intelligent animal is nothing more than property and by posting this, you’re not only advertising it, you’re promoting it. You’re an animal lover, yeah? Align your actions with your morals.
@_dimasayangakandatang_ jerk
@shriya_saran1109 you do know your everyday items require resources that contribute to death of many animals and loss of homes right?? Unless you live off the grid and every thing is 100% hand made you’re being a hypocrite
@sondre.j06 thanks
@glaucialolli soooo you’re saying owning a pet is bad??
@stacy__anne  of course lol 😆
I think that The rock has indeed the power to release those precious animals. Anyone agreed?
@_dimasayangakandatang_ just  tryna help
@c_willie_ yes you are a bad person because you know the truth but you don't do anything about it. No, it's not an option to do this cruel things to them just because you want to "see the wonder of the planet" you are just justifiying your ego and not giving up your privileges as a human. A lot of activists support projects for the environment, a Lot of activists do a lot for them but it's not enough because of people that still doesn't care. You are still supporting explotation and cruelty. We can get out the contamination from the sea, we can ban ships and a lot more but there is people like you that just don't want to give up "ocean food". We can make a huge impact and reduce a lot the global warming by not eating meat and closing those farms but nobody wants to stay without a burger. Yes, the people who know it's a bad person because they know the bad and good and still doing the bad.
@glaucialolli did you just really tell some one to get out of your comments on someone elses post??? Hypocrite much I take it you’re not a pet owner because that would also make you a hypocrite!!
😡
@jamesmillegan u do some research u need more than me!
I am in awe of these creatures too. Which is why I would love to see them free in the ocean along with their family instead of in captivity having to live in a pool beeing someone co-star.
Y’all the rock just trynna enjoy his trip in peace. Chill tf out before PETA comes in here and makes everything worse
@_dimasayangakandatang_ nah even if they were rescued, doing party tricks for humans is not okay. They should be kept safe and given as natural a life as possible. These animals are used for entertainment.
@gurpreett_bhatoyaa oh but he asked you?!? 😂😂😂
@dawnrobertsonx thanks pet!! Xxx
@orsyka46 hahaha ok there sunshine  I'll go eat my seafood and enjoy my SeaWorld trip after my trip to the zoo ROFL
Staggering intelligence yet kept in a pool.... sorry what?!!?
@jamesmillegan 🤦🏻‍♀️
@therock Please be kind to animals and read up on zoochosis and the mentral trauma that comes with being kept in captivity. Use your platform to help, not hurt, these creatures. ❤️
Super cool😎😎
@shriya_saran1109 Shut the hell up
This is sad:( you should not support these beautiful creatures being held in captivity for money
THIS IS NOT OKAY , THIS IS SO FUCKING DEPRESSING , THIS BEAUTIFUL ANIMAL SHOULDN'T BE KEPT IN CAPTIVITY... 💔 CAPTIVITY SUCKS
@sean_gnm - Well don’t need to look at your profile to know your obviously brain dead. Try being locked in your home forever and see how you get on.
You're just going to ingnore your gorilla friend now.
This is not cool :-((
You people just get offended over everything. Unreal. You are a legend Rock, keep doing you!
Just another reminder @therock wild animals don’t like swimming in the human equivalent of a bathtub. Do better.
Excactly this animal it is so intelligent and it is so sad and terrible have it in aquariums , use them like their are things , this isn't cool , isn't fun , isn't a honor for u , this is a crime those animals belong to the sea doing what they supposed to do , they aren't happy there so please research what is speciesism , if u love this animals love them in freedom !! Don't be a part of this !!!!
"Families make up a large part of your audience and fan base. This is sickeningly irresponsible to promote. Dude come on. Take these down.

You and your team know better because my previous comments get deleted.

@indominus16extinction are you serious? Yes, I would rather it die in the wild and natural habitat and not by our entertainment.
ESTUPIDOOOO!!! #emptythetanks
Funny how those of you posting these comments have private profiles ....
that‘s sad😔
What are YOU hiding? Eh?
@alexcampbell2207
👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
@sonic2726 That's a bunch of b.s.! Google how many animals have died at the Georgia Aquarium. That's not conservation! Watch the documentary Born to be Free and then tell me how you feel about conservation and the Georgia Aquarium.
🖓🖓🖓🖓🖓🖓
This is disgraceful! No one not even animals deserve to be kept in captivity, forced to perform for an audience of ignorant fucks.
@nanniko_13 the Rock oder der Delfin?! 😂
I unfollowed after he thought it would be funny to call steak “dead cow” which it technically is but still... not something to joke about. I’m sure he would feel sad watching a cow getting murdered.
@nicolemikilla
@walrus_whisperer Great to see you on here Phil. We have a lot of mutual friends on FB.
Ohhhh this is awsome!
Follow me fast full support
He's not supposed to be there, @therock 😢
@if6woz9 Gpod to know you are educated on the Russian captures. If people would watch the documentary Born to be Free maybe they would think twice. That was so gut wrenching to watch. Its terrible to think some are still held up there. All we can do is try to educate as many people as we can.
Fuck this photo, of you were in such awe of these creatures you’d use your  position as an “alpha” male to shed light to others that this is simply unexceptable and that animals should  not be used for entertainment. I used to idolize you but now I’ll never watch or listen to anything that includes your name. Get a grip @therock @jamesaspey @jairolop3z
😍
As we all have a voice.... because of your celebrity status, yours  may  be more  heard. you should  use it to help them and not support.
Sad
You should see them in the wild instead of a jail cell made by humans to display animals for entertainment #veganfortheanimals @diaryofafitmommyofficial
Thank you ❤️❤️❤️@shriya_saran1109
He should delete this fucking post @ethically_elizabeth
@sarah__vin beide 🤫
@toddschroeder_ 😂😂😂 ok
Because a big jacked up douche on steroids thinks he’s being compassionate and a nature lover, he should do more research on the cruelty that is behind the scenes of this poor animals that are held in captivity but yet again if you can take steroids or eat meat do you really give a fuck about anything, happiness peace and love makes you a great human not all the money in your bank account. Celebrities who have made it big time should do better with their fame to help change this damn world like @mileycyrus @arianagrande ❤️🙏🏻@riptide42
❤️❤️❤️@glaucialolli
@paola_nr lindii
This photo reflects a massive falsehood - this whale was NOT rescued or being rehabilitated to be returnees to its natural environment. This whale was stolen and is a “thing” to be used by humans for bullshit like this photo. Truly disappointing in 2018 to see this shit. @boopio @plantroots @snutz 💔💔💔
Blackfish is a great movie for humans to watch to learn how major companies treat these animals only to be displayed  for entertainment #veganfortheanimals @veganmagick
He should delete this account @theneonrunner
So mean 😢🤧
I get people don't like aquariums or zoo's, I personally don't visit them unless it's for educational purposes  BUT if we didn't have large aquariums like this then to heal sick animals , release healthy animals back into the wild then we as the human population would end up killing off all aquatic life with our pollution, trash & waste then there would be nothing left... I mean look at what happening in Florida right now... #redtide #lakeocheechobee
You should start a petition or have all your friends report this post to be removed!! Story it post it face book it what ever !!! To many younger generations idolize the rock and his message couldn’t be anymore confusing and wrong for our generation to look up to @crystalhefner
Preeeeech
Looks a little bit like a juiced up baby oil wearing monster supporting animal cruelty and advertising it to his millions of followers @streetartglobe
Not awesome check yourself @nikkohurtado
So disappointed to see that you support and promote this!!! 😢😢😢😔😔😔
This animal belongs in the wild....then captured....then cut up.... then on a plate at restaurant...or as an delicacy....or used for clothing...or keep them in the polluted oceans...when trash is abundant...and toxins is killing marine life anyway. But the @georgiaaquarium is wrong for at least attempting to care for marine life. Im going to the aquarium. Enjoy complaining. @therock 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
Anything for money 💴 the devil owns them they have no soul @nick.king.3386
What’s cute about this !? It’s pathetic actually @ijustine
Are you sure about that comment !? Or does @goodmorningamerica promote animal cruelty !? #govegan
Right on mate @renderloyalty
@georgehumph 👍🏻 yeah wake up!!! #stopthiscruelty #setthemfree @therock
These animals are indeed very intelligent creatures. Not something they can say about you. Fucking asshole!
@the_newbie_vegan_diaries pretty sure @eazydazy is confusing veganism with something else as their post makes no sense at all
@the_newbie_vegan_diaries nobody does thankfully you should try asking the whale if it does and then ask if it cares about your opinion as much as you do 🙃
É show de bola 🎊
@therock Just to be clear: YOU looked into the eyes of a beautiful creature with staggering intelligence, and walked away feeling good about it being kept in a cage, exploited for your pleasure?  Think about that.
Animals in captivity is not ok!!! Make a stand against it @therock 😢😢
People need to STOP hating because aquariums do a lot for the marine life. Most of the animals in aquariums are incapable of living in the wild or they are injured and they are healing.
@shannkell32 guess he’s special and got to go when they were closed so he got to actually enjoy his time there.  It was so crowded that it sucked for us.  And I bet his food bill wasn’t no damn $70 😂😂
Fuck you. Monster.
Terrible act of cruelty.
Terrible act of cruelty.
Nice
Just a pity there is famous people promoting animals living in captivity.. Your fame brings responsibly of being an example for your followers @therock
😘😘😘😘
@ludacris seriously? I thought you were better than this
Shame on you.
@ludacris shame on you.
Sad..unfollowing
Guys. Chill out. The Rock is doing what millions of us do otherwise these ENDANGERED animals wouldn't survive.
@indominus16extinction im not blaming anyone. Im sure most of the staff have nothing but love for this animal. but nothing matters only that this animal should be free. thank you for your response.
This is so, so terrible. Animals are not supposed to act. Their place is in the nature. Free.
So disappointed

«In awe of these creatures» - supports animal cruelty

REPEAT AFTER ME: WILD.ANIMALS.BELONG.IN.THE.FUCKING.WILD. THEY ARE KEPT IN CAPTIVITY TO ENTERTAIN SELFISH PEOPLE, PLEASE DO NOT SUPPORT THIS, THEY LOSE THEIR HOME SO THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE THEM, ITS CRUEL PLEASE STOP IT
I love for
@pulzx AWWWWWWWW !!!!!
This is animal abuse, please don’t support this actions.
Cute
Please don't support captivity!
👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼this is so cruel
In one side we have a monster from other world and in the other side only an a strange dolphin
EMPTY THE TANKS.
For god's sake let animals free!!!!
What a piece of shit of a human being
So sad... #emptythetanks  #beconscious
@therock i think your co star need a bigger place to live......like the ocean?? He will be happier free ❤️
Shame on you 👎🏼
I don’t think you’re aware of what horrific thing you’re promoting and please just stop encouraging this abuse
I love dolphins so cute
You support imprisoned animals... Cool
You should not be promoting captivity for entertainment, respect our creatures and the lives they should be living
💔💔💔
Cool
@shriya_saran1109 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
A sham he isn’t in the ocean/wild :(
@if6woz9 Well I probably would still go to see some dolphins doing tricks. And seriously with the money they gain from this it would be pretty hard to shut an aquarium down 😂
😣😫 why? keep them free!
@nick.king.3386 I mean zoos and aquariums are great for animals who can’t survive in the wild because they’ve been incapacitated. All zoos aren’t that bad and it’s great for people to experience the animals first hand.
@nikkohurtado : Maybe have a look/think and see why this is about as far away from ‘awesome’ as you can get. Try living in your home for the rest of your life and see how you get on.
Animals don’t deserve to be locked dude , what are you posting
So kitty and nice ❤️

@dollfin74 Nobody cares take your comment off too while your at it
@nick.king.3386 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
@wrigleylindav you think you know? you’re not a dolphin so your comment is invalid.
@eazydazy No my parents are not vegan. They also do not have 112 Million impressionable followers that look up to them. So I don’t see your point?
@malachim1102 That last comment was petty af. We don't look to nature for our morality. Animals kill and rape eachother. We have moral agency (know right from wrong). If you can survive, be healthy, and eat delicious food without harming animals, you should. In the western world in 2018, you absolutely can.
#emptythetanks
Can you please take this irresponsible post down. This animal belongs in the wild not in a pool. This is cruel and I urge you to use YOUR intelligence to understand how horrendous putting mammals in captivity like this is
The life and freedom of this animal is worth less to you than a couple more numbers in your account. Thought you had more to you. But you plain trash man. This is below the lowest you can get. @therock
Well this is disappointing to see. 😕
Wild animals should be free. He belongs in the ocean! 🐋
Should be in the ocean not trapped in a pool. This is just wrong
@the_newbie_vegan_diaries My point is stick to being a vegan and don’t drag animals down with you germs. Your facts are incorrect just like veganism. Did you know vegans give the lowest amount of brain cells then any other human being even less then an animal does to its off spring? My point!
@felicia_elle disappointing
112 million followers and that kind of platform is used to promote animal cruelty and obvious abuse. What a sad world 😪
@fionaanne17 😞
@r2d9000 leave me alone
@eazydazy Don’t drag animals down with us? Do you know what veganism is hun? 🤔
Beautiful and Staggering intelligence!!! Yet locked up in a prison for humans entertainment! Please do not promote this!!!!
😔
@therock I've lost all respect for you. I thought you were better than to support the abuse of animals, which are being incarcerated in concrete tanks. Fuck you.
@shannkell32 mannn wtf?! 😡
@estefainejunior clbc
Yes, such beautiful animals with staggering intelligence should not be kept in captivity for your entertainment. Please, stop promoting animal abuse.
@rodrigueskaryny fme faz calar aqui trx
Dude... you should be an example. Such a shame. If you know how intelligent these animals are, then please make the connection that they should not live in captivity
@noragriffinstudio 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

@the_romeo_09
Shame on you for promoting animal captivity and entertainment to your 112 million followers! 🚫🚫🚫🚫
Please help stop this and not help to promote 🙏
:(
@fircone Unfortunately we are the most ignorant creatures upon the planet, would you rather it die via bio-accumulation of microplastics? It might not even survive if it was released back into the wild, it could have been born in captivity, and sadly it's natural habitat might no longer be safe.
@therock be wise and don’t support the animal captivity please
Just because it's in captivity it doesn't mean that it's not enjoying its life, not to say it should be this way, but it may be the best way at this moment in time, at least until humanity gets its shit together and that needs to happen asap.
@taysshan Well I said in another comment that humanity needs to get it's shit together asap, but your right its not a permanent solution its tenporary, maybe when ignorant dickheads worldwide stop focussing on their insignificant lives (in the grand scheme of things) and start focussing on something much larger like another species (beluga whale for example). I would love to help change the world for the better but I'm only 15 years old, so it's currently up to the older generation. Excuse my potty mouth.
Yes a beautiful intelligent animal that should not be in a swimming pool, it should be free in the ocean. @therock please don’t promote this and Georgia aquarium
@flynnpictureco yes they are... shame we can’t say the same for humans. This animal should be free in the ocean not held in captivity which you are now exploiting for money and entertainment. Think, is this what you really want to stand for?
@cf_2132 Listen here dickhead. I'm only 15, It shouldn't be like this its my dream for all captive animals to be released into the wild, but dickheads like you keep dreaming and dreaming yet do nothing to help the cause. And before you say I'm a hypocrite I'm too young to do shit. Excuse my foul language.
not cool
This wonderful creature only want to be free.... not a prisoner to be watched by stupid people 😡
@indominus16extinction  dude,  no hard feelings brah,  appreciate your thinking,  the thing that you might have overlooked is that you said look at the face,  those animals are not meant to do that,  and if they are doing those stuff,  it came with a excruciating price, paid by the animals.  Being 15 doesn't mean you can't do much,  cause I'm a teen too and we can do loads to stop this. Cause when teenagers start to boycott these kinds of stuff, obviously parents would not be interested in visiting those kinds of places .
@danielledreelan I'm 15, and actually beluga whales are highly sociable and intellectual creatures, they are capable of expressing their emotional state through facial expressions, chirps, squeals, clicks, and whales. So, please my lady educate yourself before making such a "silly comment".
If you're so impressed, you should campaign for their release back into the wild. Imagine you being stuck on a set for a movie for the rest of your life, playing a part for survival and never knowing freedom again. That's how they feel. Use your celebrity status for positive change.
@chity14 I know they do actually.
@haven.varcoe Even if this was the truth (which I don’t think), does that make it ok to make profit out of them, to starve them so that they do tricks for us that are completely unnatural for the species? Don’t think so.
@shriya_saran1109 absolutely correct! How can he support that ,I’m so disappointed in @therock 💔💔💔
@if6woz9 absolutely agreed !!
@taysshan I apologise for what I said, you are entitled to an opinion, and I do also appreciate your thinking.
@ijustine i feel sorry for you ,educate yourself about what these Animals go through...
@indominus16extinction there facial expressions are not representative of them being locked up in captivity. Theyre trained to be a certain way. its not natural. the silly comment was referring to the fact you think this animal looks happy so this okay?
How disappointing you supporting this... 💔💔💔💔
@danielledreelan also age is irrelevant, being 15 is not going to change my opinion on the fact you made A SILLY COMMENT
You should not support this @therock . Be intelligent enough. This is animal slavery.
@danielledreelan I appreciate your thinking, but I do not think it's okay just because it's happy, let say it is happy, It can't be unhappy about something it has never had, but that is not to say it is right I absolutely agree with you that it should not be locked up, it should be released into the wild but thus animal would not survive out there because it doesn't know how to, nevermind the increasing harshness of its natural habitat. But also you're same logic can be applied to us, we are trained to act a certain way, think a certain way, and that is also not natural, we shouldn't blame staff at the places like this, we should blame the governments that allow this to happen. But once again for your insightful view, and I apologise for my previous reply, it was rude for me to respond in such a manner.
@jaclyn.howell oh so stupid. I am just not stupid enough to think that a person going to the Atlanta aquarium means they support animal captivity.
😢
Nooooooooooo
Bad rock
Bad bad rock
Very bad of you very disappointing , not a good move to sponsor animal captivity
@haven.varcoe well taken care of?!? YOU should do your research
You support animal abuse. You beed to watch “INSIDE THE TANKS” & “THE COVE” & “BLACKFISH” and learn, you will regret this and feel sorry for these perfect creatures youve did this and supported captivity and abuse and exploitation.
@danielledreelan I realise I made a silly comment. Like I said apologise for my ignorance and I respect your opinion and criticism.
This is disgusting
@therock  really? You call them intelligent, but support their enslavement. Stop promoting animal abuse. They should be free, not in an aquarium on your instagram. Please, reconsider your actions and help them.
Do not support this 😢😢👎👎👎 @therock
Lmao u people always got something to bitch about
@estefainejunior engraçadinho vc né 😒 vou te mostrar os ataques deles
if it's so awesome and beautiful why is this intelligent creature locked in a tank
@estefainejunior e isto é uma baleia beluga ta querido
😭😭😭😭😭
This is horrible, these animals should not be "co-stars", they deserve to be free in the vast oceans where they belong! Do not support oppression and slavery, it is not a good look! @therock
Poor animal! 😢
Such a let down... #freethetanks
So cute
So cool
🐋🐋🐋
As you can acknowledge that the beautiful animal is intelligent, you should be ashamed for supporting it being held in cage and not have a free life. Things like this makes me realize just how far we are from an awaken world. Sadest thing ever. Hope you come to realize it very soon too.
The love is in the air
Shame on you
Yup a life without worrying about predators is horrible....wonder how many of these crying hearts have a pet of any kind.....these animals are treated far better than most pets.....and eat better too haha.
This isn't your costar this is life being held captive and forced to perform for a bunch of assholes.
🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
🤬🤬🤬 This is A HEARTBREAKING PIC!!!!!!!!! Ban captivity !!!!!!!!
You are a perfect match😍
Wow
This is nothing but wrong. But hey thanks for showing me why I’ll never watch anything with you again or support you in any way. Maybe again when you grow a heart.
@tamara.matosevic
Check out my music link in my bio, pls🦇💔
Vile that you are promoting captivity like this!
It's sad to see a kind hearted person like you posing with a tortured, captive animal that gets used as property just for human entertainment
I you were in awe for these creatures you'd fight for their freedom because they can't live a happy life in captivity. Please do some research about these animals and what aquariums do to them to make them an entertaining product of their industry.
They are beautiful and intelligent creatures. However, keeping them locked up in captivity can never show us their true beauty that is found when in their natural habitat. #pleaseDONTposewithanimalsinCAPTIVITYforpictures!!
I always thought you were a shitty actor, but now I know you are also a shitty person who supports animal slavery
This photo makes me sad. Plese show some compassion towards these captive animals. This photo is so disrespectful... They belong in the ocean not an aquarium so humans get entertained. Supporting this kind of industry (zoos/aquariums/circuses/etc) is absolutely disgusting... :(
Free him!!!!
No more captivity please!  It's heartbreaking to see this. @therock please don't support abuse.
It's exploitation!

@beautyfull_karma_ look, you’d choose to get locked up. that poor animal would never do that.

It’s staggering beauty

Indeed the beluga whale is amazing and intelligent, it should be in the ocean, their natural place. Not entertaining humans in a small tank. Respect animals, let them be alone in their rightful place. @therock don't support animal cruelty..
The poor animals. 👎👎👎
Why are you so insistent on exploiting animals? You have a huge heart for humans but animals are just props??? Do you know that these animals are stolen from the wild from their close knit families? They are drugged and starved to perform? Suffer from depression and live only a fraction of their lives in these bathtubs they are forcefully confined in? Get a clue!!!!
Y'all really care about animals wayy more than people.
😍😍😍😍😘😘😘
@brian6499 😍😍
Not cool 👎
Rock
Cruel. This beluga is a prisoner as are the other sea mammals you are working with. Next time think about what you’re promoting. @therock
Beautiful.. both of them!
It’s so funny that most of  these people saying that it’s wrong for this whale to be in captivity have dogs or some sort of pet, don’t see a problem with Petsmart or Petco, have 0 knowledge in aquatic animals, or have plants (plants are living things too).
#emptythetanks this baby belongs in the wild or in a sanctuary free from exploitation
THIS IS NOT OKAY ‼️
Vc eo melhor mano
Please stop supporting the captivity of the beautiful creatures! They should be living freely in the ocean!
Sou seu fan
#dolphin with one of rear spices #thegreatone
Im so sick of you and ur stupidity! Way to go on endorsing captivity and enslavement! FING closet case republican too!
This is horrible! By posting this you are supporting animal slavery. Please watch "The cove", "blackfish" and "earthlings". Google Specism. This is not cool, that animal belongs in the ocean. #animalliberation #govegan #saynotocaptivity
These poor creatures deserve to be free, not life in a glorified cage. Dwayne, instead of using animals in captivity, how about helping them instead?
This is a wild animal, it should be free. Disappointed to see this post
That is an awesome “Beluga High Five”
👎
Shame on you for encouraging this kind of cruelty. If you're ignorant to it, please watch the documentary Black Fish. Unfollowing.
If this whale is so smart, why is this whale in captivity @therock ? He/she should be free. That’s what @domzthompson believes. But he also wants to challenge you to a fitness competition. For charity of course. If you lose, you’d have to go vegan for 30 days... and in that instance, you would win a health boost.
No bro
@therock #govegan
@beautyfull_karma_ you know, you’d probably be safer locked up too but do you want that for yourself? i don’t think so
Beautiful  session
Hi, Have seen post in Facebook from you that you are giving money, cars etc. Hope it is fake or Prank.
@bjornhowl it is a fact that animals are not treat well in aquariums. And it’s my opinion that people shouldn’t promote it when there is information out there that shows them why these places are not the best! That’s all I’m saying about it. Don’t have time to argue about it. Again. My opinion, but it’s based on facts! Ok byeeeeee
This sure is a beautiful being, but it saddens me to know that it’s life is in a tank when it should be swimming hundreds of miles in the open ocean. I hate aquariums
@crueltyfreemuscle idk I'm watching orange is the new black and I think I could handle it. 3 square meals a day with free room and board, and if u think your free in this world u got your own set of problems to worry about lol
This is so irresponsible @therock :( please watch the documentary blackfish and educate yourself on the horrors that happen in this industry. Like you said - these animals are so smart and deserve to be in the wild! #setthemfree #emptythetanks
Way to be a douche and support the abuse and incarceration of your “next co star” dick
Not cool! 😔 choose compassion ❤
Nice ❤❤
@kristencampbellll ERRGHHHH. The fact he supports this ruins Moana for me 😩
DO NOT SUPPORT SLAVERY
Wowww🙏
Please don’t support animals in captivity 😡
@amyj007 it's a fact that they're not treated bad there. And you're correct that it is you're opinion. The only "info" you're getting is from sites that tell you these things are facts. Or, u take the information from correct sites and then twist it. So in all reality, most of these "facts" are just facts twisted into your opinion. Have a nice day
This is not a co-star. That animal is not supposed to be in an aquarium.
This intelligent, awe-inspiring animals deserve respect and freedom. Stop supporting animal slavery @therock
A whale in a pool, that's nice...
😡😡😡😡 dude I thought you were smarter than this!
Same hairstyle. Fab.
This makes me sad. You’re my hero, dude. You speak out for children. Why wouldn’t you protect the rights of animals, also? This Georgia Aquarium doesn’t have a great track record and this type of entertainment built around commoditizing living creatures is a generally unacceptable practice. These animals are being exploited. It’s been days and you haven’t responded to the criticism. I’m but one disappointed fan, but disappointed enough to have to take a break from Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. You still inspire but for the first time, you’ve left me deflated. Keep doing the great things that you do. Think about some of the ways you can make this world an even better place than you already have. Much love. Hope to follow again soon. ❤️
Buuuuuuh for promoting animals in captivity! Shame on you!
Nononono!!!!
😞😞😞😞animal needs liberty too! Not captivity
@veganmagick First of all, many of the animals in the Georgia Aquarium’s care are rescues. Do your own research if you don’t believe me. They are leaders on the rescue and rehabilitation platform, and even send staff to assist other rescue organizations around the country. I agree that in a perfect world animals should live peacefully in their natural environments. Unfortunately, humans can be blamed for a majority of the life threatening situations these animals are put in. We should support organizations that aim to protect our marine life in their natural habitat, rather than shame them. As for “exploiting” the animals, many people will never be able to see these animals in the wild, and facilities like the Georgia Aquarium gives some the opportunity to appreciate them in person, while ensuring the best care possible. Please educate yourself beyond the Blackfish propaganda.
The love os
Stop promoting animal abuse
@amyj007 you're not being very factual, and to have to choose either opinion or facts. And not to mention, you're saying things as if they're facts
Animals do not belong in captivity.  This is sad and i wish you could see the influence you have...should be condoning these beautiful creatures being taken from their homes for entertainment. 😝😑😟
Yes, they are very intelligent but should be in the ocean and not looked in a pool and being abused by humans - this is not a life, it’s a prison!
Boo. I love you but for shame. If this animal is so beautiful and intelligent doesmt it deserve freedom and happiness? Please stop supporting animal abuse.
There is no beauty in captivity. Please dont promote this cruelty @therock
@saving_the_most_i_can that's because they are part of everyday life, also half of this comment was questioning things that he said already. Also the FILM blackfish isn't a documentary
@ijustine there is nothing “cute” about slavery and captivity
@therock please educate yourself and don't support captivity!! #emptythetanks
Yeah must be AWESOME to be forcibly taken from your habitat and family, and forced to entertain human ignorance. It’s 2018 Dwayne, you can do better than this.
@glaucialolli yes I am informed and the FILM blackfish isn't a documentary because almost every. Single. Thing. Is a lie or propaganda of some kind
I fucking love the aquarium! 😬😬😬😬
@jgsdelapena
@apelnich so you say all animals should be jailed? All those bastards are an other problem to talk.. but animals have to be free, rhink a little bit.. 💪🏽
@blakemccollum I want to do this!
You admit this animal has staggering intelligence and yet you support its captivity and suffering???? YOU MAKE NO SENSE BRO!!! Stop with the supporting of companies involed with cruelty to animals!!! Cmon already @therock
@shriya_saran1109 correct!! @therock stop supporting companies that promote animal exploitation and torture!! You know better!!! Disappointing is what....fucked up
☹️☹️☹️☹️ This is so wrong!
@bjornhowl Right, I did not deny that they were part of the daily life. We were TAUGHT that it's fine to have zoos and aquariums. However, these are man-made and simply because we have done something or have had something for a long time is a justification for enslaving sea life just so we can get entertained for a few hours. Actually, Blackish IS a documentary film. You can literally look it up.
Nada ver manter animais em cativeiro 😧
@therock over 5 million people have liked this post. That’s 5 million people who have no idea the suffering and torment these beautiful creatures go through living in a tank. Could you imagine yourself living in a 4 wall room your entire life, when naturally you want to roam freely? These animals in the wild swim hundreds of miles a day, and in a tank, it must be pure torture. This is not cute. This is 5 + million people that are uneducated and need to know the truth about captivity. Please consider educating yourself and using your platform to be a voice for these beautiful creatures
@literallyaim not so bro!! These conditions change their behaviour !! Makes them suffer emotional and pshycological abuse and keeps them from seperated from thier family members and others they need relationship with..stop making dumb excuses for the companies that behind this!!
@literallyaim human beings having "fun" at the expense of the suffering and misery of animal's is unacceptable. This way of thinking is extremely damaging and careless. Some people have fun raping or beating up others -- dont make it right does it!! Do the world a solif and Grow out of this unevolved mentality
Oh nooo 😢😢😢
@ashlynshore LMAO HOW IRONIC
These beautiful animals don’t belong in a tank!!! Don’t support!!! Don’t encourage!!! Don’t promote!!!
So awesome!!!🌊🐋🐋😎
oh Dwayne @therock nooooo!!!! 😢....please read @domzthompson  response.. you need to know and be aware of this industry ..... :(
@therock he belongs in the ocean, not a tank.
So sweet..
It's really sad this pic 💔
Love this, check my profile out & dm me 👍🏽
@ellispeteellis bye Felicia
@lexi_roman22 I WANNA DO THIS
@lexi_roman22 AND I WANNA HANG WITH THE ROCK AT THE AQUARIUM
Hey it’s not good man, they are wild animals and deserve to live in the ocean rather than in this cage!!!!!!! Your post is encouraging people to visit aquarium! I don’t think it’s a good idea
Your "co-star" belongs free in the ocean. If you truly cared you'd not support the imprisonment of this, or any, animal.
👎👎👎
Even more awesome when they’re not held in captivity.
@jayjm3s96 double me too 😂😂
Shame on you for not understanding these animals are imprisoned and tortured. It is exactly because they are intelligent creatures that they should not be captured, bred, and held in small tubs to be displayed in inhuman, humiliating pseudo-shows.
@if6woz9 ❤️
@apelnich better life than being trapped for entertainment their whole life though.
Promoting slavery? I had respect for you
Fuck aquariums forever
Wooow...!!!
It’s a shame that beluga is kept out of his natural habitat and forced to do things...
Awesome
😍😍😍
Please Jesus and the virgin.. @therock was cancelled a long time ago but he won’t go away. Now he’s into promoting animal abuse, slavery and torture for his next paycheck. So...⚡️? Pleeeeeease???🙏🏼
HOLA, SOMOS EL SOLIPSISMO, NO SOMOS UNIDADES DE SERES INDIVIDUALES, TODOS SOMOS “DIOS”, SOMOS UN UNICO SER Y UNA UNICA MENTE QUE APRENDE Y AUMENTA SU CONSCIENCIA GRACIAS A LA DIVERSIFICACION EN MILES DE MILLONES DE CEREBROS QUE VAN DANDOSE CUENTA DE QUE ESTA EN UNA FASE POCO EVOLUCIONADA, DE QUE LOS SERES QUE CONFORMAN “YO” ESTAN DIVIDIDOS Y ENFRENTADOS EN PAISES, IDIOMAS E “INTERESES ECONOMICOS”, DE LO ATRASADO PARA LA RAZA HUMANA QUE ES QUE LOS PORTAVOZES DE DISTINTAS AREAS GEOGRÁFICAS “PAISES” DIGAN: LOS DE MI “PAIS” PRIMERO, DE QUE LAS PERSONAS SE SIENTAN MAS REPRESENTADAS POR LA IDEA DE SER DE SU PAIS QUE POR LA IDEA DE SER DEL PLANETA TIERRA, DE QUE EL SER HUMANO PIENSE EN PEQUEÑO, DE QUE NO LUZCA, SE COMPORTE Y ALCANZE UN DESARROLLO PROPIO DE UNA RAZA PLANETARIA AVANZADA E INTELIGENTE CON UNA CONSCIENCIA PLANETARIA Y UN PENSAMIENTO GRANDE
Please do not support wild animals in captivity.. they’re suffering worse than you can imagine.. it’s heartbreaking what they go through.. belugas for example live up to 60 years in the wild, but only to 25 in captivity.. #freedomofanimals
Not cool. #animalsarenotentertainment
There's nothing awe of a captive beluga whale 👎
❤️❤️❤️❤️
@camila.tiemi what do you not understand. I never said this was an animal conservation! So before you go accusing me of saying things, and putting words into my mouth, I would advise you to actually understand what I was saying. I do not supports zoos and I never will. I support animal conservations where the protect the animals and release them back into their homes when they’re supposed to
That creature is a prisoner..taken from their natural habitat in order to entertain humans and do tricks. This is not respectable or dignified to do to any creature. It is exploitation and slavery, same if it were done to a human. Aquariums and the like need to be shut down. This post unfortunately does not take a stand for a good cause, but perpetuates an evil destructive industry and objectification of other creatures. Watch the documentary Blackfish
What is th3 movie called lol
Super
Nice
Osm
Wow
Toop
This beautiful baby should not be kept captive. Shame on you for calling him your co-star. ☹️☹️
These animals are neglected their natural habitat so they can be held captive for human entertainment. This is not OK.
😢😢
disgusting.
These animals belong in the wild. This is prison for them. Please don’t promote this. @therock
Dwayne, no more posing with captured wild animals please. You’re better than this.
💔😔 sad that you support captivity. Im you fan, but you’re supposed to set an example, what your doing here destroys the job of thousands of animal rights activists, that are trying really hard to educate people about how bad this place are for this innocent animals. Please be more kind and educate yourself about this subject.
@ethically_elizabeth god you’re good!
@babrown86 stupidity at its finest
@jayjm3s96 😧😧😧😧😧😧😧 not fair !
👎👎👎
@jamesaspey ✌🏼
How sad that this amazing animal is captive in a tiny little pool for entertainment 😢
He’s absolutely gorgeous
Please stop supporting animal slavery and promoting it on your page, bro.
So sad.  Those aquariums are horrible for the animals!!!
So sad 😭😭😭
Intelligence so staggering it knows its wants to get the fuck out of that pool and be free you stupid rock head mofo
😔😔 this is so sad
@therock why are you promoting this Aquarium?! You have the money and the power to help these be free in the ocean where they belong ❤️🐋
@therock please stop showing the kids and people who look up to you that animals being in captivity is ok. These animals belong in the wild with their families. Locking them up for peoples entertainment is not ok. Please help spread that message. You could help save the world.
Please, watch the docs Black Fish and The Cove. Animals don't  belong to captivity for human entertainment. It' cruelty!
I think if you were aware, or more so if you listened to these true and inspiring comments, you would not be supporting such terrible acts of slavery! I,and I think it’s fair to say a plethora of others are truly disgusted in the fact that you are supporting these vile acts and also therefore setting a terrible example for your many fans! If you think that these poor creatures desire to even be in the small tanks that they have no choice but to live in, but to perform the tricks and tasks that they are forced to for the mere purpose of others’ blind entertainment and money, then you should think again! This post has outranked many including myself and in my opinion, you should rethink any thoughts on how you view such unspeakably wrong establishments. This is truly heartbreaking! 💔 @therock #protectourcreaturesofthesea
@rock I’m disappointed in you. 😶
@ngc1976_ ❤️❤️
I wonder how much his co-star got paid? Life in captivity!
Lol so many triggered people. Keep doing what you do best @therock
@therock this beautiful being deserves to be in his/her natural habitat.  Image being stolen from your home and forced to exist only to amuse humans.  Animals do not exist for humans. They deserve to be free just like any human does.
Don’t promote it being held in captivity than, to recognise the intelligence but not care about the unnatural surroundings because you priorities some movie... so unfortunately human
Reminds me of the song Baby Beluga by Raffi
Awesome shot. Thanks for sharing.
@giannagallo28 DUDE
#Rampage
YOU have a platform. DO RIGHT BY IT. SPEAK UP FOR THE VOICELESS. Very shameless of you. Don’t be fooled by the magnificent creature’s smile.
U animal
Been a while since you made a bad publicity move Rocky, but you well and truly screwed the pooch here.
In no way is this funny or cute. They are intelligent, sentient beings who do not belong in captivity. Animals are not here for our use or entertainment. @therock Disappointing that you use your platform to promote cruelty to others. #endspeciesism #captivitykills #emptythetanks
NO ...just no. This beautiful animal belongs in the ocean.
Not cool, not one bit. Taking z photo with an slaved animal that is starved so that they perform tricks as if they were clowns, is heartbreaking. Not cool
Its 2018 you  should  know better @therock  i adored u as an actor after seeing how u promote animal cruelty i will think twice
Beautiful...Wild...Intelligent...in captivity? 🤔
I admired your work ethic before I saw this picture. There is nothing admirable about posing with a prisoner. Belugas are native to the Arctic circle, an environment that can never be replicated in captivity. The oceans are unique! What you perceive as a smile on their face is actually a tormented brain, someone stolen from their family in the wild and kept isolated in a concrete tank. Please educate yourself on these magnificent animals and then educate your fans so that this brutality can end!
So maybe use your celebrity and your influence to set it free... Do something good with yourself 😉
You should do your research on the horrors of the marine mammal captivity industry. So sad
@therock please consider learn a bit more about the captivity of wild animals! This beautiful animal belongs in the wild and not "working" with you on your next movie...
these animals shouldn’t be in captivity.
😍
I THINK THE ROCK is doing something that I would have done. If I would have been there and could have gotten that close to those mammals I would have done everything I could to pet them and to interact with them. Just because they're in aquarium doesn't mean that the rock is supporting animals in captivity.
These poor creatures don’t deserve a life in a tank. I’ve always loved and respected you @therock, but I really hope you read some of the comments on this post and see the harm that can come from publicly supporting aquariums like this.
If you were so in awe of them, you would be very displeased about their captivity. C'mon ... :(
@therock I am in awe of them too! Thats why myself and many others do not condone the capture and confinement of these beautiful intelligent creatures. Please consider this next time you go to an aquarium. Also, feel free to check out the documentary Blackfish on Nexflix! 🐋💙
Thank you for supporting an accredited aquarium!
This world has come to the point where you cannot do anything without being criticized and people saying things they don't even know what they are talkin about. If you go to the SPCA or an animal shelter to pick out a dog or cat does that mean you're there to support caged animals. I think most of the people in the world. A grow up and think about the kind of nicer things people are trying to do than to say the rock supported wild animals being in cages I think that is so far-fetched and whoever said this I don't have a punch in the head from him. I love all kinds of animals and if I can get to interact with them I will whether they're in a cage or not I don't approve of any animal being caged at all but if they are endangered and need to be held in captivity until they can be able to produce more of their selves and be taking care of that they can be released and create more of their kind if we don't do things like this to help all the animals we're going to lose all the animals in the world because they are not being taken care of and they are not being protected. The polar bears are dying because they are starving since all the glaciers and the ice caps are melting they can't get on them to go to where they can get food to survive soon they will all be gone and all the other Generations will never even get to see them or know what they were some of you activist take everything out of content and make it look bad for the people who are only trying to see what animals we have left and I think whoever did all this about Dwayne Johnson is a horrible rotten person to make up such a terrible story. And maybe the Beluga might be a better co-star than half of the stars that are around today. My congrats to you Dwayne Johnson I think you're a wonderful human being and any other animals you are going to see I would be glad if you would let me know and take me with you thank you for taking your personal time to go see these mammals and interact with them I think that's very wonderful when people sea animals and start to learn about them. So Dwayne the Rock I am with you 100% tell everybody else who doesn't like what you do to go to hell
Just look at this beautiful animal kept in captivity with staggering intelligence. Nice one @therock
They deserve to be free 😞
@therock Please, please, do some research on captivity. Watch Blackfish; Earthlings; Unity and others.  Animals are not props or costars for entertainment.
Poor captured, tortured, enslaved and probably mentally unwell animal. He belongs in the ocean not captured and used for making money. Know better do better.
I loved you and this really ruined my opinion of you. PLEASE THINK ABOUT YOUR CHOICES! Your such an icon to millions of people, use this for good❤️
This is sad.
This is like, so awesome!
You have such a huge platform. You can do way better than endorse animal slavery. That is exactly what you are doing with this. And letting your huge following think it's ok. Not cool.
Thts my guy
You make me sick.
Hey @therock you're and action hero who rescues people in your movies, how about rescue those captive in real life like this beautiful soul who was kidnapped (or bred in a tank). They deserve to be free not driven insane, anything with intelligence should not be kept in a cage
You’re weak, just another celebrity puppet with too big an ego
Pussy
#EMPTYTHETANKS
OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG @shreya90803
Please take this down. If you truly love animals then you wouldn't support this.
Sad you would promote this. It is not ok.
Great
George transformed into a Beluga Whale and moved to Georgia! Lol! 🤣
Amazing
@mfall0n hahahaha what a joke
My Mom Loves dolphins🐳🐬
Nooooo!!!! Please don’t! These animals should never be kept in captivity. It’s incredibly cruel and selfish. Please educate yourself about this problem🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 and please don’t not make a movie that promotes the capture and enslavement of these incredibly intelligent and complex beings. ( the seal too) not cool 😑😩
Too bad this beautiful animal with staggering intelligence  is a slave held captive.... #stopanimalenslavement
Too smart to be in a damn tank.
Disgusting. How can you smile when looking into the eyes of a wild animal kept in a cage for your entertainment 🤕
@saving_the_most_i_can I swum with a whale shark this year (in its natural habitat). One of the most incredible experiences of my life. They can live up to 100 years. Some up to 150! In captivity they only live up approx 15 years. That’s not even sexual maturity which is 25 years.  In supporting your argument this is just one example.
@kellyrickels I can’t believe he was so close to us and I missed him!! 😭
I love you and am a huge fan! 😀 I used to go to dolphin aquariums and Sea World too especially growing up in San Diego.  I just didn’t understand it about captivity and how wrong it is until I saw the academy award winning documentary The  Cove  and BLACKFISH ! if you watch both of those you will never go again!  I understand because I did the same thing I “didn’t get it” but nowadays with education and social media and Netflix, sharing information is EASY! you’ll never want to go back again even though we love them with all our hearts they should be free and not swimming in cement tanks their home is in the ocean! Thanks for caring! 💙🐳🐬🐋💋
A whale is not a costar, and not meant to be kept in captivity. Please don’t support aquariums making money off of the exploitation of wild animals being imprisoned.
You got to go home. The highly intelligent individual you got to meet, does not. Infact, instead he/she is forced to live out their life imprisoned & isolated in a chlorinated tank
Noooooo 😣😦🙁 please stop supporting this . You’re so sexy but this just takes you down a few notches
Cruelty
@408.destiiny yeah but they use animals they “rescue” these animals and use them for profit so  this is not animal conservation. Keeping an in a tank is captivity!
This is awful! @therock this beautiful being should not be locked up here. It should be free in the wild. Every animal thats taken from its natural habitat into captivity creates the process towards extinction. These species have been proven to show signs of stress when put into a tank and left there, it's like looking a human up in a room for it whole entire life and taking it away from there family. If you are in AWE of these creatures do the right thing and don't support captivity! Support FREEDOM! This is not ok.
Disgraceful @therock . Utterly disgraceful!
@lewishamilton surprised your liking a picture of the poor animal that is locked up and get in a freak show rather that where they belong
NO PLEASE DONT ADVOCATE ANIMAL CAPTIVITY.  ITS CRUEL😵🤬
Didnt know @therock was a peice of shit? I knew he made shitty movies but was unaware he was a shit person
This sentient being is not an actor, they don't rely on money and fame, they aren't living their natural lives in captivity, they don't belong there in a chlorinated pool ! 😱💔 wake up @therock
@madvenna yes they should be in their habitat where poachers and whalers can get to them!
@holy___666 lol ur comment is ignorant as fuck and really poorly argued. Yer it’s alright that disabled kid is already on show at the zoo I just wanna go admire him and show everybody im admiring him and learning about disabilities.
NOT CUTE.
Sad in Montreal. This animal is forced to live in a bathtub. It's not cute. Love you but please take a moment to watch @blackfish. It's the reason so many bands like Heart, Beach Boys, REO Speedwagon (and tons more) are now all refusing to perform at places like this.
Staggering intelligent so we trapped it in a cage to live out a life of misery. This sucks, stop supporting and promoting animal abuse.
Joan Jett wrote a public statement telling Seaworld to stop using her music.
Honestly I figured you would know better than to promote this shit. Do better Dwayne.
So sad to see you endorsing these beautiful creatures being put in a big glass box for human entertainment. :(
DUDE that’s insane...never saw a whale wearing shorts before!!! 😜😜
Please watch @blackfish_movie. Especially since this post. Thank you from Montreal.
Dang. Watch @blackfish_movie to see why these animals should be free and not in confinement
❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️EVERYONE SUPPORTING AND LIKING THIS PHOTO PLEASE EDUCATE YOURSELF. WILD ANIMALS ARE NOT OUR PROPERTY. THIS PLACE IS NOTORIOUS FOR ITS ENSLAVEMENT OF WILD ANIMALS. THESE ANIMALS ARE KEPT IN SUB PAR CONDITIONS AND ARE, AS A RESULT, HALF THE REAL ANIMAL THEY SHOULD BE. WE LEARN NOTHING FROM ANIMALS IN CAPTIVITY- ONLY WHAT THE TERRIBLE AND CRUEL CONSEQUENCES ARE OF THEM LIVING IN CAPTIVITY AND NOT THEIR NATURAL HABITAT. EDUCATE YOURSELVES ON ANIMAL SUFFERING. ‼️‼️‼️❌❌❌❌
Love you Rock
Watch blackfish my friend very educational. We can’t endorse these intelligent creatures being locked in glass containers and cages. They deserve better. We have the ability to be aware and spread awareness. Use your power wisely.
Followe please
Followe please
I am from iran
Please realize that non-human animals value their lives just as we humans do and that supporting aquariums (or any other type of entertainment which uses animals as attractions), is sending the terrible message that it is ever acceptable to commodify a living creature - which as you should know, is not. Not ever.
Awful
Adorable
Muito show
Disappointing to say the least. You should be ADVOCATING for these beautiful animals, not promoting these disgusting money hungry businesses that seek to make a profit from the innocent. Please get educated.
so sad, @therock 😪 this is a wild animal. a tank is not the right place to it.
Olha meu direct por favor !!!!!!!
@shriya_saran1109 well said!!
Hi five
when is this creature being released into the wild? And why is he being used to take photographs with people and forced to be kissed by them (searched the hashtag)? I would hope you don’t support this type of cruelty towards animals.
They don’t belong long in an aquarium Dwayne! You should be standing up against this... not promoting it
@shriya_saran1109 don’t listen to haters you are 100% correct!!! They should be free.
And yet again you promoting animal cruelty 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ what a bad way to use your influence. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 used to be a fan. Not anymore. It is 2018 for fucks sake! 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️😖
This is so wrong!
Fuck you.
Wild animals belong in the wild. Captivity kills. Please watch @blackfish_movie
@ethically_elizabeth 🙌🏼
Admire them from a distance, or perhaps you can admire them as they're getting chopped up for entertainment/food, use your strength for the weak and the voiceless, countless others in your position have. Making them incredibly strong and courageous standin up for the right thing, you lack principles morals and ethics and anybody who's physically strong but mentally weak is a pussy in my book.

Yes, they are beautiful and intelligent. And should have never been captured and imprisoned. @therock
@jessydias00 Yeah!✌
This beluga, like all wild animals held captive in aquariums, was stolen from his home, drugged and forced using starvation methods and drugs to perform silly tricks for humans. They can swim so many miles a day in their habitat, the ocean, however while captive, they are held against their will, like this whale, to be a prisoner.  These are smart emotional creatures who deserve better. They were seperated from their families to be stuck in a pool. Please watch documentaries on captive animals. Some documentaries I recommend to open your eyes are Black Fish, The Cove and Dominion. Animals belong wild and free, not held against their will like prisoners. This is not okay. We need to be showing all animals compassion, the same we would expect in their position.  Please visit a sanctuary next time where you will find animals who aren't used for money. ✌🏽 @therock
Shame on you. These animals should not be held captive.
Wow
THE ROCK ARTIST Share ART!!! - WORLD TRAVEL HISTORICAL CULTURAL ART OWN ARTIST, AMAZING!!!
I would be in awe, if you would stand up for animal rights, instead of posing with imprisoned creatures..
Animals shouldn’t be kept in tanks for human’s entertainment! That’s animal cruelty. #endanimalcruelty
So sad that you’re supporting animals in captivity. They belong in the ocean not in a tank that they can’t barely swim to entertain humans. You’re a great actor but this is too disappointing. Please educate yourself and stop supporting this!
Um. Not a co star. A slave. Don’t keep animals in cages. I won’t be supporting this movie or anything you do any further. Get a grip.
Cool
Animal cruelty and you are promoting this.. shame
@theeloosh
No hablen inglés
You are an awesome dude but PLEASE do not promote animal cruelty.
Wow!
They should be out in the ocean not posing for pictures or helping Hollywood make money. Really sad you would promote this kind of crappy treatment of a beautiful creature who doesn’t belong in a tank for human entertainment ☹️
So disappointing 😞
Man this is so fucken lame. This is a wild creature not some fucking joke for your next money maker. So disappointing that the awful life this gorgeous animals live is being glorified. They face terrible treatment day in and day out. They are not movie props they are living creatures that need to be put back in a home and not in a concrete tank the size of our bedrooms.
💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
😡
👎🏻
👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
Unfollowing you - how can a human with any decency think this is acceptable?
😥😥😥😥😥
awesome CAPTURED AND EXPLOITED animal.
@therock some candy ass on face book keeps posting these fishing posts about you giving out money if you share and post win. please look into it and address it thank you . keep kicking ass and taking  names God bless Carlos.
There's nothing captivating about captivity. 💔
Nice 1
This sucks, this whale deserves freedom not to be your entertainment 👎🏽
@thechilliestofpeppers I want to do tgat
Shameful 😡😡 #captivitykills

Tomara q ele te coma
Cool , so richtig süß
You should be in awe of them! But in the ocean where they belong! I bet Mitch would never support this 😓
Shameful. So many kids look up to you use your platform to not promote captivity and torture instead of being in awe of it
You’re the only celeb I would fan girl over and I general watch any movie if you’re in it. But it breaks my heart every time you participate and promote animal exploitation. Please extend your love to all beings. 💔❤️
Disgusting!
What a tragic thing for you to promote. I guess you haven’t watched Blackfish 💔
Its impossible that someone like you is not aware of what they suffer so you are posting these aquarium pics being well aware of the atrocities. SAD!!! they are not supposed go be cute and friendly :they are more powerfull and stronger than you and in THEIR homes they would fucking destroy you mister bigshot!!!
Why in the world would you promote captivity? I used to like you, now , not so much. So very sad.
This beautiful animal belongs in the wild 😢
Dude, please watch @blackfish_movie and open your mind to the fact that this animal is being held captive at @georgiaaquarium, unable to live his life the way nature intended. 💚🌱👌
I’ve lost so so much respect for you @therock thought you were better than this 😑
I thought it was fake lol
Disgusting. Do you research. You should not be promoting this cruelty
This is not good!!!!! Get informed about animal cruelty!
Rock......cmon dude....get with the times! 👎
@c_willie_ check out Blackfish
These poor animals are being held in captivity against their will and live a horrible life despite you trying to make them look happy with your smile. So disappointed in you Rock.
CAPTIVITY IS NOT OK!! 🚫
Staggering intelligence yet enslaved to man . #anythingforadollar
@rafamarcondess_ 😍😍
coooool
You know this pose is not natural right? Only god knows what this animal had been through to learn to shake your hand... :(
@lia_dozal its annoying as Fuck.
Please stop promoting cruelty and Please watch The Cove documentary and check out @dolphin_project You can learn how these amazing free animals are stolen from their home and tortured for your entertainment and payday @richardobarry
How very sad. My heart goes out to this beautiful creature ripped from its home only to be someone’s property and rented out as a cash cow. Shame on you for promoting such a horrific industry
Not cool at all, educate yourself before promoting this shit
This picture make me feel so sad and uncomfortable.. this is not okay! So many people will think this is great now because YOU posted this, while a lot of people fight every day to make it stop.
@ddiana411 I know they’re all saying “you lost a fan” and “I’m unfollowing you” like ok go ahead he still has many more fans.
@veganmagick thank you for saying what needed to be said. @therock please don't do this. Their exploitation is unnecessary.
You admit they are highly intelligent, so you must admit that they understand they are in a prison and are forced to perform for humans. Animal slavery is not okay, watch blackfish.
This isn't "your" anything. It's a wild animal that shouldn't be used by humans for any purpose or display.
Boo No longer a fan! This animal should not be confined to a pool. Shame on you @therock 👎🏻
They belong in the ocean.sorry to say this is not good.p.r
#ANIMALCRUELTY #STOPANIMALCRUELTY
I would do the same thing Of I were you!!
This is a poor animal. Should be living freely!
This is really disappointing... beluga whales should not be used for entertainment :(
❌☹️
#boycottaquariums this is straight animal cruelty and exploitation and whatever horrible movie your poor “co star” is being forced to be part of, I will be boycotting that too. As the rest of your movies until you end your support of animal cruelty. I’m very disappointed in your support of this Rock.
Boo. Shameful.
what the hell??????? is it a joke????????
😢😢😪👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽poor Beluga! Very sad to see this! I didn’t think you would post something like this! @therock
Noooo @therock this is not what you should be posting to your millions of followers. We should not be supporting captive animals. Now kids will think this is 'normal' and 'right' and grow up just as corrupted as the rest of the people applauding this post. They are not for us to own as property they are wild animals. Please rethink your posts as so many people see them and idolise you. It would be good to delete this post and start rethinking now.  Thankyou for reading
Not cool
You suck! :( I always loved you man, but this??! Make a difference!
@reinahroo19 if you could live until 150 years old in captivity, between four walls, with a full team of doctors but otherwise away from other human and social contact, would you choose that over freedom and a shorter lifespan?  They should breed them into captivity and if deemed non releasable they shouldnt be kept in a ridiculously tiny tank whose effects I'm sure you're aware of being you're highly educated on the topic
In awe of the creatures kept in captivity ***
As a famous person you should be campaigning for the release into their natural habitat and freedom.Dont you think  that would be awesome???
😢
Is this the message you are giving to people who admire you? take the animals that are in their natural habitat and take them to be enclosed so that they can be exhibited, really? what a sad ❌😡😭
🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼 #captivitykills
@flynnpictureco peaceful and intelligent and captured in the wild?
@birdslayeggs  you are so wrong on SO many levels. #brainwashed
@zeze.cardoso.9 sim eu achei 😍
@ddiana411 and that’s why you and all your children are overweight 🤷🏽‍♀️ go eat some more corpses since it’s obviously doing you so@much good 🤢😂
You are a great actor and a role model to so many.  This beautiful animal lives in the equivalent of a bath tub for their whole life, all for the entertainment of humans.  Please don’t support aquariums. 💔💔💔
Everyone should go read @domzthompson 's post about this. #DontBeCaptivatedByCaptivity , this poor animal is a prisoner.
#captivitykills #animalsarenotentertainment 🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽💔💔💔💔💔💔
@shriya_saran1109 there’s a picture of you with a camel that’s chained with its mouth covered. I’m sure you’re a real activist. Gtfo here. I’m sure that horse of yours would rather be running wild as well, but oh that’s right that’s your morning workout buddy. You’re a hypocrite.
It’s so horrible that these animals have to suffer their whole life in such a jail...
Look at all these keyboard activists smh not a single one of you has actually even tried to do something about animals in captivity. Now you’re coming at @therock ?!?! This man has done so many charitable things and has absolutely donated more time and effort to animals, and people in need than you have. So please stop acting like you’re some sort of saint now, using this great mans platform to type your mind away, because you’re too soft to actually go out there and do it. Rock, keep crushing it brotha you’re a true inspiration and a solid dude 🤙🏽
Stupid, just... stupid 💔
@therock you should feel sad that this amazing, beautiful creature you talk about was kidnapped from his/her home and is being forced to perform. They didn't chose a life of entertainment like you did. See them as they are: slaves! And do something to help instead of justifying their imprisonment to your followers
@lefildeno cedric😉😉😉
Cool ! 🙌🙌🙌
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
How can you not realize how cruel captivity is??? It’s not that difficult to do some research and see how awful is for these animals to be held captive in pools for the amusement of humans! You should be ashamed of yourself! Use your fame to raise awareness not to promote captivity and animal cruelty!  @therock
Yeah wow...on of the most intelligent animals and perfectly put in captivity😒good job humanity, good job.
Shame on you!!! 💔💔💔💔
@ddiana411 at least he would probably have more compassion for these animals than you do 👏🏽 sorry the truth drives you to call people names but thank you .. I am full of Charisma Uniqueness Nerve and Talent 😘 CUNTY QUEENS rule the 🌎
@plantbasedcurves  1. Wolves hunt in packs.  2. Declaring you’ve proved your point doesn’t make it true (I’ve proved my point... see?) 3. I know you’re reading this. 4. Buh bye
This poor creature had his freedom stolen away
@literallyaim Good point about apex predators not being around, however animals do not tend to live "happier and longer lives" as painted by zoos and aquariums. Out of all the orcas that have died in captivity, none have died of old age. Animals in zoo also show severe signs of distress, therefore proving they are not happy. ABC News (not biased) released an article on how elephants in zoos, one of many animal species, live shorter lives in zoos than in the wild. Here's the link if you have time to read it https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=6449110&page=1
@therock please please consider the cruelty these animals face before promoting the Aquarium they’re locked in like a prison cell. Most aquarium workers don’t even know what takes place to capture these animals in the wild and how evil and cruel the people who own these aquariums are. Owners pay people to steal babies in the wild from their parents!!! It’s a sad but true reality that animal activists know and live with everyday. I respect everyone’s right to live how they wish, would just like to inform others of the truth rather than just seeing these beautiful animals and thinking it’s “cute” that they’re there. With all your followers and all of Hollywood’s influence, pray you all would research and promote love and respect to all wild animals in their own habitats living on Earth with us!!!! 🙏🏼💖
So gutted that you support animals in captivity. Expected way more from you @therock. 😔
@b.janej
Please do not support this kind of cruelty 😢😢
@harrychallenor can that be me!!!!! Oooooooo
@therock please take a moment to read the post by @domzthompson
Wow
Sigue cumpliendo con tus sueños como actor y como ser humano bendiciones mi hermano
How can you support this? Is not your co-star. He belongs in the ocean!
I normally admire you @therock but you’ve let yourself down here. Why promote animal captivity??! You are so influential. Instead of promoting the use of animals as entertainment for humans instead promote the need to save these animals from extinction in the wild and for everyone to change their ways to protect the environment and prevent animal exploitation. Not cool dude 😡👎
😥 sweet ocean animal needs to be in the ocean
😢 Not cool.
@ngc1976_ beautiful.  Thank you.
You should’ve had one of us, the photographers at GA Aquarium shoot your beluga!
Please take note of all these comments @therock It’s 2018, this abuse needs to stop, not have you promote it!
@rebecca_b_land thank you for factual information. ❤️
@goodmorningamerica obsessed with animal cruelty??? Idiots.
I’m so sorry baby 💔💔💔 I hope one day you will be free of captivity
@shivam_di_caprio
@ethically_elizabeth has stated more facts and used less vulgar language than most of you on this thread. And most of you are just reiterating her point. Any of you posting about other social justice issues to distract from the original issue are unfocused and uninformed as they are all linked to a system built on injustice and greed. Oh and @therock do better dude. This is just sad.
@ultra.stank rarely
"This is indeed one very beautiful animal, which would be even more beautiful and happy if it did not have to live in tiny concrete aquariums filled with chlorinated water being held captive for human entertainment! Couldn’t be farther from their natural habitat.
Please take a moment and educate yourself on how aquariums get their (bloody) hands on these beautiful creatures. Unfortunately Georgia Aquarium is no exception to this...
#thecove"
Awesome
😡👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼 #notourentertainment #teachcompassion #endcaptivity
Help free them @therock they and all the other beautiful captive animals need you. Now that would be a movie. ‘Returned to the wild’... (VO) “in a world where slavery is considered acceptable, one man will stop at nothing to set them free” (queue music)...💪😬 💚🌱
Beautiful animals who don’t deserve being in captivity for our human entertainment ✊🏽💠💕
Beautiful animals who don’t deserve being in captivity for our human entertainment ✊🏽💠💕
@shriya_saran1109 Fuck off
Rock- you are better and bigger than this, supporting animal cruelty. Man up and protect, not exploit.
@therock Wow, this is utterly unbelievable. Going to have to unfollow after this one. Please do not endorse this cruelty. ☹
@ethically_elizabeth my gawd get a life
@mclovin4594 do some research on the background of the Georgia aquarium.  Everyone knows.
This is not cool. They belong in the wild. #emptythetanks
Shameful. Seriously. That Beluga should in the ocean he was stolen from. 💔
Yes, beautiful animals that deserve to be free turned into puppets for human entertainment and greed. Sad @domzthompson 💪🏽
@djornnow man man idd
Love it
@ddiana411 this is a platform for everyone to speak their opinion. I get it you probably don’t care about animals in captivity but this is still wrong for us to misuse animals like this. There is nothing cool about this.
💔
I cannot imagine that The Rock @therock doesn’t know how inhuman and cruel this is.  I hope that this picture was taken at gunpoint and he will soon take it down and remove himself from this exploitation and advocate for these beautiful creatures.
😡😡😡definitely not okay
So sweet.
Q linda mascota Roca💪💪
My favorite their so cute with their big heads.. The whale not the Rock ..lmao ...
It cool
poor animal! it belongs to the sea! @therock
AQUARIUMS SUCK!!! FREE THE ANIMALS
Set the whales free! Use CGI if you want a whale costar!
#emptythetanks i had to chime in as is this is not okay. Put yourself in the shoes of the victim. The whale cannot be a costar as they cannot be paid and are being enslaved. Would you work with a dog if you knew it was taken from its home and locked in a small yard made to perform every day for food and died there in slavery? Or a human in the same situation. They are here with us not for us
I always thought you were a shitty actor, but now I know you are also a shitty person who supports animal slavery
@literallyaim Are animals allowed to roam freely in zoos, as they would in their natural habitat?
These animals must be in the ocean, not aquarium, strange that you Mr. @therock support this madness! Same like you put children or other human beings to the prison and bring all the animals to make a selfie with them!!! Sad to see that, I was sure you are different kind of star, not like others who cares only about money and popularity... @domzthompson
This beautiful animal us being hekd captive..it should be in the wild in its natural environment..dont support aquariums or zoos..this picture is everything that is wong with the world..celebrities giving the wrong message to all the people following them..promoting and animal for entertainment is beyond immoral..
Haha
Aquariums are prisons for sea animals. This is exploitation and captivity merely for profit 💔
👉🏼👉🏼 you suck for this.
Vaya que bella experiencia.😊😊😊
😭 so sad.
Classic fuckshit... not surprised
Lies, he’s an imprisoned mammal. Irresponsible @therock
Maybe be in awe of them out where they belong though :( people see this photo and don't understand what happened to get this beautiful animal locked up. It should be in the wild where it belongs
How the F can you support the captivity of beautiful wild animals? Dude - what are you thinking!
That beluga whale probably hates you and the tank it lives in
This is terrible.  You’re promoting captivity.  Promoting imprisonment and theft.  These beings are enslaved.  As in NOT FREE.  How do you all still think it’s okay to inflict suffering upon others for profit.  These creatures are MISERABLE.  There is a sad, horrible truth behind this photo.  You all need to put yourself in others skin, fur, scales and imagine what their stolen lives must be like.  Hell on earth for most.  Wake up and speak up.
So sad...
Such a beautiful creature deserves to be free and happy, not getting famous people more likes on instagram.
Agh the ignorance
@saving_the_most_i_can yes and so does aquarium animals. They also tend to live a happy longer life since there are no predators
But let’s be real, he’s not a co-star he’s a prop #freethewhales
@ackeepsitcool20 shame on you rock
Exactly beautiful and intelligent. Should not be held captive in a small concrete bathtub. This incredible creature should be where he belongs IN THE OCEAN.
Stop promoting captivity you have millions of followers and you should be setting a good example to young children and adults too. This is sickening
This is so incredibly cruel! Please, STOP supporting encaptivating of these amazing creatures!
Thats NOT okay 🤨🤔😥
Whales don’t belong in movies or amusement parks.  This post sucks @therock
PLEASE see them in their native habitats rather than supporting their captivity. Animals in aquariums/zoos lead truly horrible lives. They deserve better than to be kidnapped and imprisoned for our entertainment. #freethewhales #emptythecages
Is blackfish the only movie you guys know? Are you paying attention to what's happening in the wild? Until Humans learn how to protect the Wild that WILDlife thrives in all your posts and unfollowing is void...so the Beluga is free in the wild then what?  The artic is falling apart, it's being overfished and melting, polar bears are starving and so on and so fourth..there are tons of animals that are in the wild slowing becoming extinct, how can u expect animals to thrive in the wild if we aren't taking care of the wild itself...overhunting, pollution, and encroaching on habitats building new homes. Soon zoos and aquariums will be the only place to see these creatures sadly
@inkdchik27 ever heard of demand and supply? If people stop paying for this shit and promoting it, other cruel assholes will stop encaptivating them
@marisad0730 yes it does. You pay for it. You support it. Simple.
@goodmorningbeautiful_ preach !❤️
Stolen away from their families, forced to live in a tiny chlorine tank where boredem drives them literally insane, all the while being starved into performing tricks for something to eat. Just so these corporations can make a profit on their torture.. Where is the profit for the animals? It is madness that even in this day and age, people still think this is acceptable! IT'S NOT! Honestly, I thought better of Dwayne Johnson. It's not difficult to open your eyes and see the suffering of these beautiful, intelligent creatures, if you love them, promote their freedom. #emptythetanks #untileverycageisempty #untileveryanimalisfree
👎🏼🤮
@therock I have a lot of respect for you and am a big fan but I am so very disappointed and sad to see that you are endorsing this awful, cruel industry that inflicts such hell on these beautiful creatures. This post is so dangerous to these mammals as you have so much influence- you should be using your influence to encourage people to see the belugas and other whales and dolphins in their natural environment, not encouraging people to visit these disgusting establishments!! @dolphin_project @whaleanddolphinorg @oceana @seashepherd
Sad someone with so much influence can be misleading people like this. Listen to Reagan and *take this down*
Dont go to these jails for animals! They deserve freedom!!
Aquariums are fucked up! Such a beautiful inteligent being caged in a chlorinated prison for entertainment.  This is sad
@therock shaking hands with a slave and with your media presence will create more slaves around the world.
Beautiful I hope I can experience this one day
You should be ashamed. You could help create peace In this world but you choose to support opression. Either you are extremely ignorant or extremely heartless. Just another mindless celebrity to distract the masses
Set him free bro... Set him free.
Absolutely terrible. If you're in awe of these creatures keep them in the wild where they belong. Not captive.
These beautiful creatures belong in the wild! Please don't promote the captivity of animals!
Shame on you. Used to look up to you for your kindness. You lost my admiration the second you were not able to recognize that these intelligent wild animals do not belong in concrete chlorinated tanks for human amusement.
@lexwhoo you know I've heard people point out that having a dog is hypocritical when talking about animals in captivity and entertainment but guess what? I don't see my dogs as entertainment! And i would hope that most people don't either. I personally see them as family and rescued them both and love and treat them with respect. I do not make a profit from them and force them into shows to perform for entertainment. So I don't see how you came to this comparison? In an ideal world I think we wouldn't have domesticated, dominated and bred any animals but right now there are a lot of cats and dogs in shelters needing care because of humans obsession with breeding them. So we owe it to them to take care of them since they are already dependant on us. And we owe it to them to give them the best life we possibly can. Not to put their wellbeing second and exploit them for a profit. That is not necessary and that's the difference. ❤
@malachim1102 I’m so proud your google search engine works - again, OMNIVORE- NOT CARNIVORE! Meaning you do NOT need to eat meat - due to farming and technology at this point in time , you can survive strictly on plants/grains ... and exactly - you can’t catch a deer by yourself . Sooooooo you are not a lion. Thank you for proving me correct . You are not a “mammal hunting another mammal.” You are a coward with a weapon or 10 of your coward buddies helping you out! Such a badass! I’m done with this conversation. I’ve proved my point
Wowo
Wow not wiw
Would be more awesome and beautiful outside the tank.
THIS IS WRONG!! 😞 #seaworldsucks #captivitykills #boycottseaworld
So sad to see this. :(
#AWH
Im not one to tell you what to do with you life or how to support or fight for. But these places inhumane.
@goodmorningbeautiful_ bbg please dont come for me, u dont know what I know or what I do, I specifically said until Humans can learn to take care of the earth the point is mute so u wasted a paragraph...I also know that animal is not found in Florida...I was using the Florida crisis as an EXAMPLE love...be blessed dont @ me again and try to belittle me or I won't be so nice next time
👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
@ethically_elizabeth lol shut up
@shriya_saran1109 People will visit the aquarium everyday and have fun whether you like it or not. So shut up
Disgusting to promote this kind of place... I’m unsubscribing.
Boycott aquariums! Your “co-star” is in prison. At the end of the day, @therock you get to leave, but those animals don’t. They will continually be USED for human entertainment and be neglected of the things that these whales live for. I’m disgusting and disappointed you would show your fans that this is okay. 💔 #shameful #animalsarenotours
@literallyaim You said it yourself, PEOPLE. Not the animals held captive there
Oh man 😔💔 @therock surely you can take a more ethical, kind hearted approach to your movie making choices at this stage in your career. So not cool. You burst the bubble for me and my family with this decision. We do not support animal exploitation or those that profit from their use and abuse. Unfollowed and unsupported. You can do better than this. These gracious beings belong in their natural environment. Get with the programme and put your voice and name into supporting them instead of taking advantage of their vulnerability.  If animals had the choice to swim, run or fly away, they would. #betheirvoice #abetterworldstartswithyoufirst #veganforourkids #veganforourplanet #veganfortheanimals #emptythetanks #untileverycageisempty #manup
@therock Please don’t condone or endorse this. Education is vital in the mission to reduce/quash mistreatment of wild animals. Please use your voice to raise awareness of the pain animals are forced to endure day after day, all in the name of 'entertainment'. Maybe one day we'll all realise that wild animals are not on this earth to be held in captivity where they are abused by those who arrogantly think they rule them!  #NotEntertainers
Literally so disappointed with you 😢
Please don't do that... That's not okay.
So wrong poor animal
@therock This is fucked up #emptythetanks #notproperty
Aquariums are prisons! They belong in the wild not in concrete bath tubs, smdh.
What a disappointment! Please reconsider your actions and stop supporting the enslavement of those intelligent beeings.
Oh lord. I am glad to see this many people standing up for animal rights but some of y’all are are real hypocrites. Probably eating a club sandwich writing that, both slaughtered chicken and pig in one bite and talking about this wale living in captivity. 🤦🏽‍♀️
Yo fuck all y’all hating on my mans here
"And yet she/he stuck in a tiny fucking tank doing “tricks” for humans instead of living it’s beautiful intelligent life in the wild where she/he belongs

Why are you supporting this if you see that in that amazing animal than how can you pretend this is okay??"
Nothing cute about captivity!
So much respect for you lost in an instant
@arduousandy Very good points you bring up. However, educational purposes for who? For people? Animals are not here FOR us to use and research. They're here WITH us. We can learn about them without holding them back from their natural habitat. There are plenty other ways to learn about them. I agree these aquariums can try to help them recover, but really how much can we help? Why do we have this obsessive desire to know EVERYTHING about animals? So much that we have vivisections and pry around while they're still alive, all for "educational purposes". Please, society has conditioned you think aquariums are just part of the everyday life.
muito lindo este animal
Omg so sad 😯😔
please stop using animals for entertainment ☹️
Captive animal, intelligent enough to know it will never be free.
@ethically_elizabeth this 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
The only place they belong is the OCEAN. This is their home and they don’t deserve to be ripped away from it. And they don’t deserve to be treated as slaves who have to perform for selfish human entertainment. SET THEM FREE ✌🏽
💔💔💔 nothing beautiful abt a prisoner intelligent creature force to work in the entertainment industry. For what? Poor thing doesn't get anything out it 😭
@su_gaga  ne kadar güzel çıkmışım yaaa
Why not promote animal liberation and freedom? That baby is not your costar. He was stolen and put into slavery. Super lame dude.
Shame on you.
😷😷😷😷
@saving_the_most_i_can by hers and your logic animals shouldn’t be in zoos also right?
@beautyfull_karma_ i didn’t belittle you. Don’t play the victim when you’re confronted with the truth. Belittling is calling someone “bbg” like you just did. You should know what that is, since you did it 😂 Maybe don’t comment at all, mind your business, and make your profile private if you don’t want people to @ you back with facts and get to know you. Simple. 😂With a quick look at your page I learned you eat chicken, shrimp, oysters, and dairy, therefore you support those industries. Therefore I do know what you do. You already showed you’re not nice by telling someone to mute themselves when they know more about a subject than you do. All you can do is say don’t @ me because you got slammed with facts.
Hi
@veganmagick so true!
PLEASE DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BARBARIC INHUMAN PRACTICE 💔 this beautiful life belongs free in the ocean. NOT in a fish bowl.
Really cool man
@lexwhoo rubbish! Any excuse to rationalize imprisoning wild animals for entertainment (and the almighty dollar) purposes. No regard for the cruelty committed to these innocent beings...🙄
@zeynepozdemirxx 😂💐
@therock pls educate yourself, this is very disappointing to see 😧☹️
Your co star? You mean an imprisoned animal who would not choose this life, but instead is forced to help you and others line your pockets. Shame on you
So sad @therock. You are right, that animal is beautiful and intelligent and that’s why it doesn’t belong in an aquarium. You are in awe then stop the abuse of animals. My family and I will NEVER watch your films again.
👎🏼
Oh look a prisoner, way to promote slavery @therock 🤦🏼‍♂️
so cute
She deserves to be free, not property for your entertainment.
What a shame...
I dont like that
@beautyfull_karma_ @beautyfull_karma_ this creature belongs in the Arctic, and would be unaffected by the Florida algae. Animals are going extinct in the wild because we are taking/catching all their food, breeding and killing them for our taste buds, fashions, appliances and toys. They are put in zoos and are unable to reproduce with their mates in the wild which is why numbers are dwindling. human intervention is the reason why they’re going extinct. If we had let them be in the wild they would be flourishing. But you are part of the problem. You support the dairy and meat industry. You support fishing, which destroys ecosystems and kills so many animals that are not meant to be caught in the process. You don’t even know what you’re talking about. Stop eating and buying all animal products - that’s how you begin to “take care of the wild” by taking a stand against animal extinction and exploitation. That’s how you can begin to help stop “all the animals” from “dying and going extinct”
Absolutely disappointed in you.. I thought a man of your intelligence would know captive whales are not happy @therock they're stolen for their natural habitat to live in tiny bath tanks 😐😐
😢👎👎👎👎👎
There's no Mana here @therock that beautiful creature is an imprisoned slave and you're standing here promoting the captivity of wild animals. Damn man, for real, thought of better of you. I know in your heart your a good dude but not sure how you could possibly go about justifying this one. 💔
Awe man. I dig you, but this is not cool. Captivity 🤬
Haters gon hate
There r people out there who consume those wonderful creatures as meat. That’s horrible
Thank you for pointing this out
Absolutely shameful. You are contributing the cruelty of captivating wild sea creatures that belong in the bloody ocean. Shameful.
How sad #whalejail #isolation #takenfromfamily #trapped #evolve #notanks http://www.wlrn.org/post/animals-captivity radio show
This is sad. Please understand that aquariums and zoos are horrible for captive wildlife. They paint these lies and talk about conservation, but the reality is these animals are either stolen from their families in the wild, as babies, or the are bred in captivity and many live short, miserable, diseased lives...all for the sake of our “entertainment”.
@plantbasedcurves if people wanted to catch deer with their bare hands they could. (It might take a bunch of them but they could do it) besides, we are omnivores for a reason. https://bit.ly/2ftTiPw
Big dislike!!!!!!! Watch "The Cove" and "Blackfish"!
@svenrump als deze man niet zo’n team had was er weinig 💡. Niet te geloven
Poor whale💔😢#moderndayslavery #someoneNOTsomething #endnonhumanexploitation
Cute couple
I'm not sure what's up with the vegans reposting everything you do with animals but I like this picture and many others. I suggest those folks need to get a life.  Keep doing YOU @therock .. You are amazing!
What is wrong here Dwayne? You are better than this. You've come from a place of pain from your past too, please don't do this.
@riptide42 maybe we shouldn't argue with people that refer to cetaceans as FISH!
If the person you portray is a fake and all you are is sell out and don't really care for anything but yourself then please! Stop being a God damn hypocrite
@therock you are promoting animal abuse to millions of people. If you truly are in awe of these creatures you should be supporting the conservation of these animals not the capture of them.
Wait what? Not cool supporting people that jailed animals.
👎🏼👎🏼 a big thumbs down to glorifying holding animals like this in captivity.
Very disappointed you are promoting captivity. Those animals deserve to be free in their natural environment. Use your platform for good. This isn’t right.
Omggg
@liberate_cetaceans Exactly what I thought when I read their comment!
Proud to see literally every comment is a person outraged by how horrible animal prisons are. If the comment supports it there’s a slew of sub comments outraged that a person is clearly misinformed that this is okay. Let’s #EMPTYTHETANKS. Also if you’re outraged at this, do some research on animal agriculture and you will see billions of beautiful animals enslaved everyday just for food. If you see what’s wrong with this picture you’re already vegan at heart #GOVEGAN
Please read what @domzthompson has tagged you in, you could be such amazing voice for captive whales as a concrete tank can never replicate the ocean. 💚
Süssss
Cool
How does this have 5+ million upvotes. Is nobody thinking of the poor animal? Held captive. Being mistreated. Wow... Disappointed.
Would love if this animal wasn’t living in captivity for humans enjoyment ...
So sad
This is extremely disappointing. These beautiful creatures belong in the wild, not in captivity. 😡
@mystique_d
Gross!
@the_alabama_texan you make a valid point in most cases. I find what you said to be true. Butttttt if you were smart you would research this exact Atlanta aquarium and delete your comment
Terrible and sad, should not be kept in captivity 😭
@darth_manul 100%
Captivity kills. Please stop supporting these places and visit a sanctuary instead 😢
@therock not ok my brother. Why are you supporting such organizations?
You do you, Dwayne! Thank you for this. As a marine biologist (disclaimer for the armchair activists: I do not even work for an aquarium but rather an academic institution), I applaud you for this, as facilities like the Georgia Aquarium and SeaWorld do an incredible job of rescuing animals and educating the public about issues they face in the wild. Not to mention that the captive animals are provided with excellent care, as i’m sure you witnessed first hand.
@therock #capitivitykills
Wiw
@birdslayeggs I don’t need lecture of a documentary, to see a beluga doesn’t belong in a pool. And even if it’s true, what you think we will lose them all, the final option is keeping that captured in their natural habitat. A very big part in the wild sea. Not a pool!
stop supporting aquariums and animal cruelty please!!!!!! 💔💔💔💔💔
I’m not going to curse you out - I’m not going to bad mouth you. I don’t understand why people think that fixes anything. Or telling someone “I’m unfollowing you” is going to phase the person .....some of my fellow  vegans can be a  bit ... much....- what I am going to ask of you . Do your research on this little baby and many other enslaved animals in these “prisons.” The Cove is about 2 hours long - start there . I promise, you won’t be singing these companies praises . Just, do your research. You’re a smart man. Step outside society’s norms on this one. ❤️
@ijustine How could you possibly think this is cute-a beautiful creature in prison forced to do tricks ????
We need more celebs like @leonardodicaprio who actually gives a dam about this planet and the creatures in it.
@plantbasedcurves who said anything about a gun? I can use two sticks and a string (bow and arrow), but that’s beside the point. It’s a mammal killing another mammal. Now again, how is it... morally? Any different? I’m trying to figure out what you think is wrong about it.
Amazing!
Having fun with an captured and tortured animal? @therock shame on you!
@mayordazebenice The Georgia Aquarium is not a sanctuary and they continue to breed cetaceans into captivity. There is no ethical argument you can make that justifies breeding these animals into slavery that should be born free.
This is absolutely not okay. Animals are not here to amuse us.
No!!!! This is súper sad!!! These amazing animals belong on their natural habitat, they belong with their families. They are indeed extremly smart and feel a wide range of emotions, including fear and loneliness. Please dont support this type of animal abuse
Please educate yourself. #CaptivityKills 🐋💔
Sadly this beluga wasn’t born with dreams of being in your movie. Everything that is natural to this beautiful being was stolen from him/her. You and Hollywood are the only ones gaining from this angel being held in captivity.
I am surprised and a bit shocked to see you supporting the captivity of these beautiful creatures. Even here in South Africa people are becoming more and more aware of the heartache and cruelty behind these animals' showcased "lives". Please rethink what you put out into the world; You have a lot of young followers who might not yet know better and who should be gently guided along a more compassionate path, respecting these animals for the individual sentient beings that they are.
@alyssa1130 He is a public figure and needs to be educated on the subject, period.
@rebecca_b_land thank you
So sad....
👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
@meowkp  You make being born into slavery fun? Captive breeding is unethical and unnatural. That’s why baby belugas keep dying at the Georgia aquarium.
@rhiannoncamille they also bring in animals that are injured or have disabilities that couldn’t live in the wilf
@cambernalnoguera 🙏🏼
Is that a real one
@abowen2911 So because problem A exists problem B doesn’t matter? This is idiot logic and a whataboutism.
Awh—- Awesomeness
Oh nooo 😭 why do you Hollywood people sell out so easy!!! I mean we know it’s a pretty dark industry but every now and again a good one comes along. And yet here you are in this picture making a fool of yourself. You’re known to be strong yet here you look weak. It made me realise how famous people’s fans are just temporary and your careers survive of of that notion. You all eventually do something you know is not right, but ya do it anyway? There’s a lot to admire you for but this is just plain disappointing 👎🏽 do better!
Holy shit, can't a person enjoy a weekend with his family with all you pussies complaining about this iver
@crystalhefner I was really losing hope seeing all the celebrities ignore the cruelty on here. Thank you for speaking up!
Muy linda foto
I’m a fan but this is straight up #AnimalExplotation ☹️👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 I will be boycotting this project . #Shame #CaptivityKills
@haulinboats Cetaceans are not going extinct and there is no reason to be breeding them into slavery to do tricks. Don’t be captivated by captivity.
This is not cool, this animal does not belong in captivity...boycotting all your movies
Please stop promoting captivity! Zoos and aquariums are not natural. These animals are taken from the wild and often bred in captivity. Please think about what you're supporting
@therock Nooooo!! This is an awful place. Please use your voice to help save the animals and let them live a life not in a tank
Very dis
@ryanruss03 right, but he shouldn't be bashed for enjoying an aquarium. He influences millinons with each post and maybe there is a miniscule increase in zoo and aquarium traffic. I think him as a public figure enjoying an interaction between another animal helps remind people they exist and maybe even look them up. There they may even learn something. These places shouldn't be seen as torture centers for wild animals. Many animals come in with critical conditions, some may simply be imported. But a lot has changed and not all of these animals are miserable because aquariums and zoos exist. I understand larger marine animals start to display signs of stress while in captivity because of the size limitations. But I think people would rather compare zoos to circuses where the animals are slaves. A ton of work goes into promoting comfortablility. And in the end these places promote wildlife conservation.
@reinahroo19 life expectancy of a dolphin in an aquarium = 5 years. Life expectancy of a dolphin in the sea = 40 years, educate yourself.

Where is the dislike button? 🤨👎🏼
That beautiful creature should be free in the ocean 😔
@dreakk dang, I liked @therock but can't condone filming a Beluga whale. Use CGI if it's crucial to the plot (which should be about reducing the human activity that is driving this species to #extinction).
He wanted to grab in the water to waste yoy
@malachim1102 still a weapon- you are not using God/nature given talent, you’re using a WEAPON to help you . Secondly , you are not a carnivore- you are an omnivore (at the most!) you can survive on PLANTS/GRAINS alone but a lion cannot . A lion must consume meat because that is how Their bodies are created . So , it is different in 2 ways! One, you need a weapon to HELP you catch this deer- you’re not going head to head with it because you’re not winning that battle. Secondly, you can survive off plants/ grains/legumes and consume NO ANIMAL PROTEIN and NOT DIE. Still confused? I’m sure I can break it down more if you need me to
@therock Stop supporting animal cruelty.
@magnoliaalderete no hay nada más cool que la roca saludando a una beluga 😍
#freetheanimal #notforyourentertainment
deserved to be free
@ethically_elizabeth This is the same unethical facility that fought in federal court to import wild captured beluga from Russia. Thankfully they lost in 2016. They continue to try and breed beluga unsuccessfully as calves continue to die. It’s hard to believe people defend this practice.
Awesome 🔥
Disgusting, it should be in its natural habitat
I dream of the day we all wake up and influence others to see ALL animals as equal and not use them for food / profit or entertainment. Why pick and choose WHICH kind of animals deserve love 💕? If you’ve watched blackfish you cry and want to save these animals . So also watch what the health on Netflix and see how ALL meat are born to die . And are tortured daily into their deaths for our greed that causes disease , cancer & hunger all over the world 🌎. We have to believe in change ! I love @therock LETS DO BETTER 😍😍👏🏻👏🏻
@therock you should make it your purpose to educate the young that these beautiful animals should not be kept in captivity. This is a chance to make a difference.
Set him free #haverespect #wakeup
So stupid!!!🤬🤬🤬
@amanda.l.morelli so let’s put all the animals in the world in concrete tanks? or let’s put humans in captivity too because this world is so fucking contaminated, we will be better captive right? a little bit of common sense! just be in this animals skin for one second and you will scream freedom right away!
Animals belong in the sea 🌊 not in tanks...!
@therock Stop supporting enslaved animals living in captivity for human entertainment 👎👎🖕
How can you suppot this @therock !!! Why don't you do something Nobel and help these suffering animals instead of making money off of them. THINK ABOUT IT !!!! PUT YOURSELF IN A TANK FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE!!
Very disappointed. These animals deserve so much better. They are not here to be imprisoned and used for entertainment 💔
Please dont support this animals in captivity ‘entertainment’ ... its wrong... 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
@c_willie_ I think this is a really valid argument. However I think the argument is also that @therock is not using his platform to raise the points that you make.
@jayne_centurion amen👌❤
@rock it's really disappointing that you suppot this ,,,
@svalentine80 dear gods this happened awhile ago just fucking drop it already
@therock please review your comments on the situation of marine animals trapped and explored by human greed. Many people here have assertively explained the tragedy of marine animals in aquariums, think about this. These animals deserve better than be seen as co-stars.
Hope he dies on set fuck this rock this name should be dumb as a rock cuz that's what he is
@408.destiiny I bet that whale wishes it could drop it too there is a recent post that highlighted it to me just now and sorry but this whale is still in captivity like so many others so it's happening now
Boycott the rock! 🖕
"Why arent you getting it,
@chrisrock? These animals are not entertainment! Please stsrt doing your research instead of promoting animal cruelty. 🙏🏼"
Not cool. Do not promoting that shit. They don’t belong in small pools 👎
@svalentine80 I understand that and I never said anything about the whale. I don’t support these places and I never will. I was saying that I support animal sanctuaries where they can get released back into the wild or where they can be protected. So if you’re going to say something, at least try to understand what I was actually saying
Please do not support captivity. These animals belong to be free in the wild. 💔
Beautiful and intelligent and trapped in a swimming pool, please don't advertise/glorify aquariums, they are prisons to innocent animals like this beautiful whale💔
@408.destiiny fair enough but you can't keep an animal as big as a whale in a snctuary and
@shriya_saran1109 !!!!!👍🏻
You mean “piece of property “
This is so sad. Did you know that Ric O'Barry was Flipper's (the dolphin) trainer, he's now dedicated his life to getting marine animals out of captivity because he realise what a monster he has released into this world: people's desperation to have marine animals in tanks. He said flipper hated doing what she did and he'll regret it for the rest of his life. Watch The Cove and educate yourself.
Please don’t promote animal enslavement! Instead bring awareness to the animal being held captive!
Extremely unfortunate that you are promoting captivity.😔
Cunt
Animals are here with us, not for us. Aquariums are prisons for these creatures. They belong in the wild, and are not here to entertain us.
Making humans aware that the oceans need to be protected is so much more important and @therock  should know better and use his following to promote REAL animal welfare and planet care this post was irresponsible
This beautiful animal belongs in the ocean, not in a tank.
This is not your costar. This is an animal forced to perform, living in captivity. Don't be so fucking stupid.
Please stop supporting aquariums! They are prisons for these highly intelligent and social beings. In aquariums they are denied everything that is natural and important to them.
Hey look!! It's the rock taking a picture with a stolen, prisoned, beautiful intelligent whale....Cool pic.....
So disappointed in you....
@malachim1102 did you really ask how YOU SHOOTING A DEER is any different from a LION EATING A GAZELLE? Since you’re such a Badass, maybe you should go and take down that deer the way that lion took down that gazelle- oh ,that’s right !!!! - you wouldn’t be able to . You need a GUN to “hunt your prey” WHAT A BAD ASS- my goodness- you are the epitome of the worlds manliest man! Any woman would be so lucky!! 😂
That’s disgusting 😱
Don’t support animal captivity!!🐳
Cruel
Shame on you for exploiting animals for your own personal gain. 😢

@shriya_saran1109 You are 100 percent correct-thank you 🙏💖
@riptide42 👏🤘
@therock this is an animal, a being and not anyone’s property.
@ultra.stank they shouldn’t be born in captivity to start with. They should be born in the wild because they’re WILD animals
@ijustine slavery is cute? Keeping an intelligent animals in the equivalent of a bath tub is cute?
This is absolutely not okay. This is animal exploitation.
@emilyskyefit yes in the wild?!
Yet they are forced to live in a jail for your entertainment only.. where is your heart at man? What about your consciousness?  You have such a huge platform and seem to be a good fella, yet you keep promoting such unacceptable cruelty :((
@flynnpictureco imprisioned foe the rest of her life ...💔💔💔
Please don’t support & promote this! These animals are held in captivity & are meant to be free!
This is heartbreaking . How are you condoning this? Do better @therock
please don’t support keeping these animals in captivity, they have not been “saved” from the wild!!
#captivitykills
That beautiful creature isn’t here because it wants to be @therock 😔 Sad to see someone of your status endorsing aquariums 💔
Please do not support animals being held captive. An intelligent species, or any species at all no matter their “intelligence,” should not be enslaved, exploited, or abused. Please do not promote animal abuse to your followers. There are so many sanctuaries that you can support, instead!
@riptide42 that animal is safer then the wild animals living in the Florida waters right now
@therock Yes, staggering intelligence. No, they should not be stolen from the wild or bred in captivity and kept at an aquarium, or be your "next co-star". What a sad picture and a horrible thing to promote. Please educate yourself on the horrors that take place there. #aquariumssuck #georgiasquariumsucks
Ohhhhh, human slaves are frowned upon but animals are no big deal. 👌🏼
I do love your acting and you inspiration gym-wise etc, and I do support you, but please don’t advertise captive animals in a happy manner when they should be in the wild ✌🏻
This is terrible! Poor animal! 😭
How sad. Prostituting your soul for paper.
You have no compassion for this creature .......👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
@ronikalet
@beautyfull_karma_ That’s true.  But two wrongs don’t make a right and that whale would be living in the Arctic Ocean, not the Gulf of Mexico...
If you know she has staggering intelligence, why would you disrespect her intelligence to such an extent where you forcibly captivate her in an unnatural and dangerous environment? If you were really in awe of her you would want to see her where she belongs! In the ocean!!! Please consider using your power as a movie star to free her!!! The movie business is crazy!!! We have all this technology now where we can literally digitally make a whale and it’ll look surreal, yet we still capture living beings to use as entertainment!!! This is the 21st century why don’t we start thinking new!!!
Booooo
Major fail rock you clown.
Stop promoting cruelty. Animals belong in the wild.
Unfollow
Poor Beluga 😞 such a shame that @therock supports animal captivity... genuinely thought he was one of the good guys 😢
Captive.
Rock I love you man, I do, but this is just wrong. It's a beautiful creature indeed but it does deserve to be kept in captivity. It's 2018 so no excuse for not to be aware and informed about how cruel this is. #captivitykills
This is awful 😔
😢 WHY?! @therock This is Slavery you are promoting and it is wrong. These "beautiful animals with staggering intelligence" want to be free just like you and me.
This is very sad...if you love that creature you can't love captivity. 😭👎
You are perfect jon
Maybe let’s not highlight and praise the jailers of these animals, huh?
@riptide42 I kno that, they are suffering worse there as well. Man is making it impossible for wild life to thrive in the wild
Don't promote this. These animals suffer in captivity.
It would be so awesome if you’d use your celebrity status and influence to shed light on the sad existence these beautiful, intelligent animals are subjected to in captivity. They belong in the wild, not in a man made tank. This picture makes me so sad for this whale. There’s nothing natural or happy happening here.
Geez, can anyone admire an animal in captivity without being harassed and crudely educated? No one knows the background of these animals, whether they needed protected captivity or not. Sit down, smh.
@tank.sinatra this is NOT good news, this is sad and bad news. Whales in captivity is tragic and twisted
@therock come on man.  I know you can't honestly support this..? If you were decent you'd help stop this kind of tragedy.
This is so disappointing coming from you!!! 👎🏽💔 you should be using your fame to inspire others to be better, choosing money for a job with cruelty over ethics and morals it’s really sad!
Vile these creatures should not be in tanks they should be in their oceans this is so disappointing
@ijustine this is fucking disgusting fuck you
@408.destiiny bullshit
Beautiful animal that should be free in the ocean!!!
👎👎👎👎👎
@therock this beautiful creature should not be in captivity..... it will have been trained to behave like this, and rewarded with food, does not mean it’s happy...... go and swim with dolphins or whales in the ocean where they are free and see their magestic, magnificence. Please don’t promote these attractions #animalsarenotentertainment #emptythetanks
animal prison
Very disappointed in you for supporting the captivity of these beautiful animals.
Oh No....really?... aquariums shouldn't exist...I'm surprised that you agree to use this creature😢my opinion😢😢
That beautiful animal needs to be in the wild 💔😢
Shame on you !! Disgusting 😡
WRONG
Really? Watch "the cove" or talk to somebody of @seashepherd, they can inform you about what is wrong with this picture.
Disappointed. 😔

Your ‘co-star’? Shameful! 😡 @therock
Would you like to be held in captivity like your 'co-star'? If you're in awe of these creatures you should fight for their freedom. Use this as a launchpad for animal rights brother.
👎🏻 those animals belong in the Ocean!!! Captivity is cruel. @therock shame on you for promoting animal cruelty 😡
@shriya_saran1109 Thank you! Very well said 💕
@trishmckendrick great response! 👏🏽👏🏽

Poor animal. Imprisoned for our own selfishness. Please don't support this!
Captive property of an aquarium. Yeah, sooooo cute, right?! 🤔
@nick.king.3386 💯❗️❗️
🐬 I love dolphins
Sad that you @therock would support the enslavement of these beautiful creatures. I’m sure you wouldn’t want to be kidnapped and taken away from your natural habitat. Sadly unaware...you.
You done fucked up @therock
😢 I can’t like this. That beautiful creature should not be there.
Very disappointed. Beautiful whales should be left wild. Not in some tiny chlorinated tank. And if it can’t be released it should at least be put into a seaside sanctuary where it can live a more natural life. 💔👎😞
Disgusting 👎🏾
☹️
They are not your co-star, they are being exploited. Captivity kills. Your better than that
Love this
@chilover14 thank you ☺️
👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
Why are you doing this to animal lovers across the nation!?!? C'mon man, animals should not be in Hollywood!!!
Nope. Big major boo to captivity! @brandonpiereder we’ll definitely be skipping this one!
@therock please don’t support aquariums. Sea creatures are not made to be property nor confined to small tanks for our entertainment. You can be their voice.
@therock I am disappointed. I thought you got in your brain than support animal cruelty and slavery. Not smart, just stupid
Has anybody else noticed that all the people praising him are ones with blue ticks??? Maybe that’s where we are going wrong in society. The most influential people don’t care or are somehow unaware?? Strange!
He/she should be free.
#EndSlavery
Free the whales! They belong in the wild not in the chlorinated water used for entertainment and breeding. Please DO NOT support cruelty !!
@carmetacroqueta jetzt hat er stark an Ansehen verloren....
Love them. Love this pic!!!
@therock I’m a huge fan of you and your work, but this is seriously not ok :(
Humanity fail.  @therock This beautiful individual is being held captive.  Please do not advocate for this.  THIS IS NOT OKAY! When we know better....we do better, and by know we all know that a tank is no place for an individual that belongs in its natural habitat.
You are an embarrassment supporting animal cruelty and slavery. Why not use your fame and money to actually get these animals back in the wild instead of sitting on them or posing with them 😠
Shame on you @therock !!!
@flynnpictureco yes when not in captivity enslaved by scum

@shriya_saran1109 have u seen the world/wild, all the animals are dying and going extinct...u seen what's goin on in Florida, sadly right now this creature is safer there then its natural habitat..until we can get humans to take care of the wild/wildlife your point is mute
How can you post this photo? There was a huge collective rage over the documentary blackfish... this promotion is not ok. These beautiful animals deserve freedom.
😢👎🏻
Shame on you.
If you’re really in awe of these creatures, as you say you are, don’t you think they should be where they belong, in the ocean, in stead of in a mini tank doing tricks for us idiotic humans? #emptythetanks
@glaucialolli 👍😘

Free them!
So cruel
Disgusting. They belong in the wild not in a tank for human entertainment. In awe of them.... go see them in the wild.

Please don’t support this @therock. 😭
This beautiful animal with staggering intelligence has no right to be captured forced and taken away from their natural habitat-their home then to be trapped inside a fucking tank to entertain you and others.
Incredibly intelligent beings - stuck in a chlorine filled concrete tank. Please - educate yourself and stop promoting captivity.

Poor thing doesn’t belong there 😓
@therock aw lame, dude. Captivity= cruelty.
Sorry to see that you prompt the captivity of animals. Definitely will not be supporting this film. 👎🏼
For you this moment of entertainment, for them a lifetime of abuse and cruelty ; no family no freedom, this is heartbreaking Shame!! 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
"Booo ...animals in captivity ...not cool😡😡😡
I used to love you man... you’ve really disappointed me with this

They are beautiful animals with staggering intelligence, which just reinforces why they shouldn't be forced to live in captivity. If you really are in awe of them, don't support institutions that use these incredible animals for entertainment. ✌

Nothing more than animal abuse. So deeply sad.
Not your costar but a wild animal in captivity 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
Shame on you
You suck
It’s so sad that @therock promotes animal slavery
Perpetuating speciesism and the slavery of animals. As bad as sea world and performing elephants in circuses. Idiot.
Two animals one smart and one not so much
Sorry buddy @therock 👎🏼 I don’t support this at all.
So very disappointed 😔

👎👎👎 @guipadua @pripalomaro not cool for @therock to promote any animal in captivity.
@theneonrunner *in this situation, you shouldve thanked them fof saving these animals
Plz don't promote this animals show animals are starved if they don't perform tricks .

Adorable 😍❤️😍
People want to talk about how zoos and aquariums are inhumane and terrible, but don't consider the actual state of their species or environment. People complain and say we should see them in their natural environment, then immediately switch views and say we should leave them alone. Zoos and aquariums make money, but they also promote conservation. I understand that this is captivity, I understand this isn't natural, and I understand they are exploited. But if all you do is complain about your views on social media then you clearly don't care. The truth is that most animals live to survive and reproduce. I'm not saying keeping them alive is more important than being comfortable. But people become inspired by these animals and go on to do everything they can to save them. What about the fact that the oceans temperature is rising, animals are losing their food sources and environments, what about the giant island of trash building up? There are invasive species, both natural and human introduced, destroying habitats.  You're not a bad person because you visit a zoo. Just like you're not a bad person for driving a car, eating meat, avoiding picking up trash, or using electricity. If all you're doing to save the planet is recycling and going vegan, then good for you. But don't bash people for viewing the wonders of our planet from the only place they can. Instead of crying cruelty, go police poachers. Go build geothermal plants and solar panels. Go get a large boat and start hauling off trash. Go work for a zoo to insure fair treatment and comfortable environments. Or go buy larger enclosures for the animals. There is a lot to be done, but the more you criticize the less someone will want to help.
Hi sir,

@glaucialolli hey you do realize that these animals are not captured right. Most of the aquariums our there, rehabilitate animals that can not be released into the wild. And once they are able to they are sent away to live amongst their own. Or did you gloss over that fact? Did you gloss over the fact that the animals that are “caged” are actually treated round the clock to vets. Are did you choose to ignore that. Did you also choose to ignore that these “enslaved” animals are for educational purposes. These aquariums inspire the young and old to learn more about these majestic creatures. Show them the world out there. Teach them about them. Etc.... of course not. You’re too enraptured with your false crusade where all you fear is shame and cyber bully people. Instead of going out there and actually educating yourself
Staggering intelligence and yet you are supporting his/her life imprisonment for your entertainment. That says a lot about your intelligence.
@goodmorningamerica obsessed with wild animals in captivity? That’s disappointing.

هلا خويك ذا ؟
I’m a fan of yours, but this is animal cruelty. These animals do not exist for our entertainment. This is shameful. Please change the message from entertainment to freedom.
Hmmm didn’t realize you were at  @vindiesel pool. Tell him I say hello
@therock - they should be found in the oceans and now in tanks.
These beautiful creatures are prisoners. Stop supporting this
@therock if he is so intelligent, do you think he knows he is a prisoner?
💔💔💔 These beautiful animals are stolen from their families in the wild and stripped of their freedom to be forced to suffer in captivity and perform stupid human tricks. Please don't support captivity. It's cruel and inhumane. It's not conservation.
So süss 👍👍👍
Noooooo! ☹️I hope you read @domzthompson post and hopefully stop promoting the exploitation of these animals 💔
Probably supports abortions too!
@karate_jon oh jeeeezzzzzzsus
Shameful
The beluga whale is mine and my daughter's favorite. It's just so beautiful💜
Good Job @therock showing support where it's needed most. Many animals are dying at alarming rates in their natural habitats and homes due to poachers, climate change, red tide, pollution, and so much more. By supporting zoo's, aquariums, and sanctuary's you are doing your part to ensure the survival and safety of these animals through the conservations around the US. Whales will no longer be in captivity thanks to the cry babies, whales are dying the by the hundreds in the wild because of the lack of food, poaching, and pollution. If they were truly "abused" then they would be shut down by the World Wildlife Federation and the Government. Anywhere that has animals has to follow federal regulations, or not be in operation.
@jeep3r76 like I said . You know absolutely NOTHING
@erkellerman sorry i didn’t see this 😩🙈 but omg no way! I’m salty he didn’t invite you to go back 🙄
Set them free :( Not meant to be in captivity. These are not “rescued” beings 😔

it is difficult to describe or put the appropriate words on this picture, so much, the animal is so beautiful, so innocent and intellegent at the same time.

Wow

@veganmagick lol "watch Blackfish" where in the movie itself says the trainer didn't follow policy, the trainer was responsible, not the facility. When animals are extinct all around the world except for the ones who are being extremely well cared for in captivity, I'm sure y'all will have a different tone. Oh ya, I hope you don't in any pets, especially a dog since you know, they're trained with treats. Gtfoh

@kevin_waddell_venom_ yes I am, stop being so ignorant to the truth or do you enjoy seeing animals suffer, plenty proof out there if you looked with your heart and not ignorant eyes
Seriously...free they're even more beautiful
@paul_walker_my_teddybear  my eyes are wide open and I’ve seen the amazing work these places do .
@mighty_mr_mooresky who said anything about peta? Not all people who speak out for animals are working for peta. We're talking about this specific situation here... and I'll keep saying it, I don't agree with animals being confined to tiny tanks and being used for entertainment like this
@karalucasphotography it's great that you are doing research and fine if you don't want to support blackfish but there are others that I suggested too. I don't think you're neutral on this situation if you are supporting this though. I never said anything about peta so i hope you can seperate me as a individual talking here from an organisation that i am not even working for. I still stand by my statement above and i hope you'll reconsider one day but thanks anyway ❤
@agirlcalledliv
@katarina_robyn omg yes. The Rock and a beluga whale that looks like your dog. Yes 😂😂😂
If you recognise their intelligence then why do more their captivity??? Shame on you. I thought more of you man

@shriya_saran1109 he isn’t supporting anything he is just having a fun time with his family at the fucking aquarium for Christ sake!! Why does he have to put up with your comments and opinions huh! Because he is famous! What makes him responsible for animal cruelty or whatever shit you are complaining for! He is not guilty for anything and you should start fucking worrying about what YOU are doing to solve the issue instead of taking your useless time to write hateful and negative comments
@veganmagick you suggest blackfish which peta worked on therefore you're suggesting it's better to support a group who think animals are better off dead than a group that actually does work to save animals
Nice and osm pic💪💪💪💪💪😊😊
😍🤦🏻‍♀️i
@mighty_mr_mooresky actually does work to save animals? How about supporting sanctuaries or groups that help to rehabilitate animas... Holding them captive in tiny tanks and using them for entertainment just doesn't cut it and does NOT have to be the only option.
@veganmagick didn't say it was the only option but yes the facts are out there that peta does next to nothing for animals whereas the likes of Sea World do genuine work to save these animals in the wild and certainly don't want to see them dead things blackfish conveniently don't include

NEVER once in my life come in contact with a real person in life who responded with such vitriol to a father showing pictures of a day at the aquarium with his kids. I have to believe there's something weird going on here because this just doesn't match up with my personal experience with normal people...
Go see them in the wild
Nice 💪

@therock if you TRULY respect these (in your own words) "beautiful intelligent creatures" then you would stand up for them by boycotting marine parks - which only abuse, exploit & hold these sensitive creatures captive. They are taken from their home & stripped of everything natural to them. Please, don't promote captivity to your MILLIONS of followers, its very cruel & unnecessary & continues the cycle of abuse. You're better than that! Please promote compassion & respect for all beings. MANY celebs know that sea world is cruel & have already boycotted them. This is no different. 💔 #captivitykills #emptythetanks

Fuck sake would you people rather they get harpooned by whaling ships and are served up as expensive so called "delicacy" sushi? Not all Aquariums and zoo's are animal prisons you single minded dipshits, I love animals but sometimes you animal activists do more harm than good, if it weren't for a lot of these places certain species of land animals and sea life would be extinct by now and how the fuck do you think research is done into their habitats, way of life etc? Clearly there are some problems with certain places like this but you don't have to be Einstein to see when animals are being looked after and when their not. Ffs if you want to protest against some shit then protest against the prick that is effectively running the world called Donald trump, a man who has denied climate change even though there are forest fires across the globe and apparently loves fucking rich bastard trophy hunters who go out into Africa and kill elephants, giraffes and lions and pose next to their dead bodies like they've won the fucking lottery for being "clever enough" to use their fucking trigger finger on a high powered rifle which the animal has no defense against. Whoop, whoop America fuck yeh! Get your fucking priorities straight dickheads!!
@shriya_saran1109 👏👏👏

stop promoting cruelty!!!!!!!!!
Those animals shouldn’t be in captivity
Either way, they will all die ,,sooner or later, I think God made them to be seen by all people, not be somewhere that no people can see them,it will be a waste of us humans won't or can't see all the beautiful creatures in this world.
These animals are being researched to inform the people to take care of them in certain ways
Are you ... waiting for the bus?
Dolph. 😊😊
@mackenziewnuck it also showed boredom & aggression they show to other whales & themselves. It showed how being trapped in a tiny space will drive you mad. All marine mammals in captivity aren't happy. Yes, Tilikum was the main subject, but it showed everything else too.
@riptide42 Well said!! 👏👏👏
@bjornhowl artificially inseminating an animal is rape (plain & simple). These are wild animals forced & bred in captivity. Sea World gets their dolphins & pilot whales from Japan. Do some fucking research about Taiji dolphin slaughters. Killer Whales were stolen from the ocean & are forced to perform & live in tiny pools. Is your head totally up your ass? A fan of animal cruelty?
I DIDNT KNOW YOU WERE FRIENDS WITH BRENDON URIE!!😂 im so emo
@shriya_saran1109 if you were smart you would realise how aquariams and zoos mostly save animals, and give people the opportunity to view them.

Hi

@kelly_arab That's what I was thinking. Not all zoos treat their animals the same. Some are nice & some are cruel. These animals don't seem neglected or abused, they seem to have a better life than a lot of people :P. Being fed and playing w/ people sounds fun. Even if you train an animal, I doubt it'll stop following its instincts & zoo critters aren't domesticated and some are released.

Wow 😄😄🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬
No... No.... No..... @therock please... These animals get so depressed sometimes that they actually commits suicide.... What's next riding an elephant?  Petting a drugged tiger..... When it's a dog that's abussed... The line is long to protest... But these animals are abuse the same way... They just get there scares hidden for the benefit of profit..... Please @therock Mr. Johnson you have my respect....and the respect of millions of people.... Use it wisely... Speak up for those who can't speak !!! 🙏🏻
I totally support this!! Without people being able to see close-up views of these creatures, nothing will be done! Even though this isn't the ideal situation for them, this must be done to save the entire species of them all. Rock on brother!
Wah
@moving.animals , I understand where you're coming from, however, without majority support these animals will die. People must get out and see them in person
It feels kinda wrong having creatures captured when they should be roaming the ocean and be free 🤷🏼‍♂️😔
Hello
NYC 😍😍😍
@jadei28 how did I only just see this?! Hahahahha
@riptide42 since when does he support captivity?aquariums are not places where they are cruel to animals, if they were they would be straight up out of business. And I already know you’ve been to aquariums and zoos heaps of times, everyone has. Don’t put this shit on Dwayne
@ebonie_isenring He’s promoting the captivity of whales.  That’s supporting it. They are cruel, which is why seaworld’s admissions and stocks have plummeted over the last three years.  Educate yourself.  Dwayne knows better.
beautiful...and he's bigger than Kevin Hart
@sc30117268 幫QQ
Everyone CHILL! Totally appreciate ya'll looking out for me and all... But here are some FACTS for you:
@riptide42 put that on the people that built these aquariums and zoos in the first place. Not on Dwayne, he’s a celebrity but he is also a normal human being like all of us who’s just checking out a aquarium.  The aquariums i have take in sick animals and rehab them and I know that for a fact! so this is very weird and new to me that your aquariums and zoos are abusers😲 But again Dwayne is not the one to blame.
@ebonie_isenring Some aquariums do great work with saving lives, species preservation and rehabbing.  Unfortunately that doesn’t make the slave trade of whales and dolphins okay for them to do.  They are highly intelligent beings, smarter than a lot of people.  Watch Blackfish and The Cove and educate yourself on this subject. Dwayne has a powerful voice and shouldn’t promote this kind of shameful and unethical business practice.  He should instead be promoting organizations like @dolphin_project or @seashepherd .
Beautiful
@shriya_saran1109 Everyone CHILL! I'm actually quite happy here! Have you ever tried living in the ocean? Shit is harsh bro, for real! Everything you've ever been told about "captivity" is a lie... I mean there are a few cases where, yeah, these motherfuckers need shut down, but damn. Stop trying to ruin a good thing! I get fed, every day! Do you know what it's like to hunt for your food? And what about other predators that look at me like a fuckin cheeseburger? I get medical care here. FREE medical. Free to me, any way. So who has to pay for that? Where does the money come from? Where does the money come from to learn about my species and protect our future with modern medicine and technology? The fee you pay to come and see me fuckin wave at you. And honestly if that's all I got to do to keep up this hella comfy life style, then shit, bro... I'm on it. If it wasn't for this "prison" I'm in, I'd probably be dead by now. Remember that, as I live a better life than most of you. ✌🐳🐋🐟🐬🐠🐡🦈
@therock Mr. Johnson, I implore you to PLEASE reconsider supporting and promoting the captivity of marine mammals for humans’ selfish entertainment. Surely the current grief being expressed over the loss of a child by the Southern Resident orca J35 must give you pause to consider the extremely complex intelligence and deep emotional sentience of these beings. They do not belong imprisoned  in bathtubs doing backflips for our amusement.

Screw all u hippies talking shit. #DWAYNEFORPRESIDENT
Here comes the animal peeps
@lakecunningham12 that’s fair enough if they are looking after animals taken into their care who are too injured to rehab back into the wild. Just because you save an animal doesn’t mean you can keep it. Once it’s healed it should go home to the ocean. If it can’t then long term care is obviously necessary. however I have read little good reports about this place. If they are housing animals that can’t be returned to the wild they also do not have the right to make them into a tourist attraction. They shouldn’t be selling tickets to shows I watch animals behave in a manner taught by humans. Animals that can’t live in the wild can and should be sent to conservative tanks/ sanctuaries where they can live as close to their natural life as possible. It’s not just the caption or this one photo. It’s what it represents. Photos like this encourages and promotes aquariums in general. Even if this place was the best of the best most people won’t be going to that one. They will go to one near them which does not necessarily look after animals and many aquariums use wild caught animals. Not ones saved and healed. The Rocks caption says nothing about conservation, whether this animal is used as an attraction or was injured. As far as being an armchair activist. I’m a front liner :) for many causes but mostly for marine life. Social media is just one way of speaking out and bringing peoples attention to these matters. And also maybe the person who runs this account to think about what they are promoting to the public in general and the consequences of that. Because like it or not people often copy what celebs do and it’s not like this story of him visiting this place hasn’t been splashed all over the media.
lol

Just common sense that they are forced to do this shit. Out of the captivity they would never do this shit. Most likely cus we treat them like shit

@andrewlee993 He is promoting the aquarium and I personally don’t like the way animals are treated at these places. Putting a name out here for a particular place makes people want to go and I just believe there are other organisations that need people’s support, not aquariums. Organisations that are there to be support these mammals in the wild. There are plenty of wild tours that can be done where mammals can be seen in their natural habitat. He has money. No excuse. And I do hear myself - and I’m allowed an opinion. Just like you are!

what the hell did he do? so if you visit the zoo you're to blame for the animals captivity? cant someone show love to these animals by just visiting them????????? cmon guys what the hell @therock can do? free them and then what????
LMAO for someone who seems to think they are being taken from their natural habitat don't forget our world history of war and violence and the fact it still goes on and that we as a race take people or have taken people away from their homes or families or even worse killed millions of people, where these animals, yes they have been taken but they are taken really great care of by people that love them. And a lot of them probably have more of a chance of survival due to the fact as a race once again we hunt and kill things that are either going extinct or will be if we don't slow down or stop so before you judge the ROCK for a picture with this beautiful animal, that is being protected, why don't you fix the human race first because otherwise nothing else will get better
very  nice  feared
@bjornhowl Are you sure you are informed? I don't think so. Have you watched at least the documentary #blackfish ? If not, you should. Hope you can see clear one day instead of saying nonsense.

Sometimes there are animals kept in aquariums that were rescued from the wild because something happened to them (boat strikes, fishing line, illness, etc) and sometimes as a result of whatever happened to them they are unable to survive in the wild anymore (missing fin from fishing line, blindness, loss of an organ, etc) so instead of releasing them to their deaths they keep them and make them ambassadors to their species to teach people to not litter, be careful with fishing line, or chemicals. In fact this whale helps researchers at Georgia aquarium establish what a safe baseline. Research that is then used to help fix problems that wild whales are experiencing due to humans. I will admit though that not all aquariums/zoos are like that and don't take good care of animals but there are similar programs at most.

@shortsandi honestly, these people know better, they just don’t care because it’s all about making money. In business and in Hollywood u gotta be a cut throat asshole and ruthless to succeed. They have no ethics, they only pretend to for their sheep audience. A guy like the Rock is way beyond my reach and I’m probably just a peon in his big superstar world. Celebrities don’t push the vegan movement and if someone is influenced by a celebrity rather than their moral compass to do whats right... well I don’t know what to say about that person. 🤷🏽‍♂️ basically Rock and people like him like millions of dollars more than they like ethics and morals. I gave up on celebrities like him a long time ago. They’re part of a bigger agenda.

To bad it’s in an aquarium and not free 😢 #EmptyTheTanks
The rock is a beast the best
To quote Daniel Schneider: I have to say I'm very disappointed in you @TheRock . Beluga #Whales  are not meant to be in captivity. They're not meant to perform for our amusement. They're kept in small cages away from family, bored. Often they injure themselves. Shame on you Mr. Dwayne Johnson
@emilyskyefit this beautiful creature shouldn’t have been stolen from the wild. Did you know this aquarium tried to import 18 beluga whales they caught from wild just a couple of years ago. Luckily they were denied. Please don’t support places like this :(
genial anelo conocerte
#I'm_not_racist, with the with dolphin and all
Two shiny bald heads with one purpose
@linpeanuts you know what’s so weird is you want them to not accuse you for not knowing you yet you just accused @michaelmuller7 for posting whales and you don’t know him..... what in the hell is wrong  w you haha 🌺⚡️ guess you’re just not in the mood to see clearly
He loves you <3
@riptide42  They swim in the water their fish you eat them their fish
I ❤️ this photo the dolphin looks like it’s giving you it’s seal of approval to have a photo with it I bet you had a splash of a time keep up the great work pal
I don't think its his fault at all if u blame him 4 taking a photo blame all the other billion people in this world who have doin d exact same thing am sure his animals are not caged I love animals in I believe in animal rites but some things rich are poor WE AS INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR 💗
Q lindo..
@dolphin_project Please read about how these super intelligent creatures end up here.  Please, use your platform to help stop this.  Rick O’Berry has spent his life after Flipper to end captivity.  You can do the same! PLEASE🐬💕🐬💕🐬💕This makes me sad.
@therock Trapped in a bathtub.
I can't believe I missed you.
@reinahroo19 actually lies
@kaylee_cassidy look yo your spirit animal
@moisesdomt kkkkkkkkkk

Looks like a great time! We just went to SeaWorld and it was awesome the kids loved. Don't worry about the haters, how else are our kids going to learn about these animals if they don't go to an aquarium. 👍
You're an amazing Man....😍
Awwww
@therock, beautiful friend
@glaucialolli no I can comment wherever I want to, it's social media. And if you don't like it, get out of HIS comments. And finally, no. I am perfectly informed, you just need to look for things other than the BS you're spewing. Hope you have a good day, but I hope that one day you'll find out you're wrong. Try to look on other sides of things
@2so.bad ooh somebody angry!
As a marine biologist I absolutely support this visit to the world class @georgiaaquarium. Aquariums like this support research and conservation efforts that save wild animals. Their inhabitants are also well cared for mentally and physically despite claims from activists that know nothing about these animals but what they have learned from watching mockumentaries.

@alliejmo The documentary Blackfish is about the whale Tilikum. Tilikum is this only whale at seaworld that had shown aggression. but what you don’t know is when Tilikum was bought from sea land the aggression was shown there and sea land DID NOT tell sea world about it. Dawn, the trainer that was killed, was told NOT TO GET INTO THE WATER with Tilikum.
@modern_keesh I’m a weeeee bit mad about this *sigh* I’ll have my day!
Gana♡♡♡♡♡
@shriya_saran1109 not true wow. I go see beluga whales does that I mean I support them in aquarium? Idiot
Muito bonita linda mesmo
How about stop trashing a man trying to have a day with his family, plenty of men out there not doing a damn thing for their kids but you’re quiet about that 🤔
Q lindo
Please end captivity. A cage is a cage.
@shriya_saran1109 do they torture them? Aren’t they fed ? I don’t see the point ! But you can keep a dog? Wtf we have dominion and are meant to interact with animals not the other way round
Estó no es bueno😡
Oohhhhh lovely
@supersizemore just happy they're getting the recognition they deserve
@bailey_perkins
Awsome I support sea world and all these places they fo amazing with all these animals

Beluga whales are awesome... that’s why they shouldn’t be captured and made to live in tanks. 😥

Beautiful.
The rock while fighting his arch nemises "Mr. B.W" prepares to end this legendary clash by using Bruce Lee's deadliest move, the one-inch-punch.'
@therock .. I hate to one up you but I got “kissed “ by a killer whale on my honeymoon 24 years ago!
check out my account ⚡️🙏🏽
@bobchilders86 Sounds like you’re pretty insecure about your masculinity.  That’s unfortunate. Did you know that male belugas are sexually mature at 8 years old?  However, most captive bred belugas don’t live that long. And none of them live the full 50+ years they would normally live in the wild.
Only the Rock could shake an albino dolphin's fin and make it look so badass.
Penguin died with that punch😂
@glaucialolli so why you flippin out cause Dwayne Johnson went there? Why are you not standing outside of the Georgia Aquarium and tell EVERYONE it is wrong?
Thanks for visiting us sir, we truly were grateful to be in your presence.
@riptide42  I could care less it's a fish
@bobchilders86  Have you eaten when they taste good
@riptide42  And you wearing a vaginae is not masculinity it's called transvestite
@bobchilders86 Whales are mammals, not fish.  Highly intelligent mammals. Clearly smarter than many humans with Instagram accounts.
@rache.indi 😍😍
@mattwaving but I got you to reply so many times 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣

@sonic2726 I know. I love it. It’s my favourite hobby. Trolling the troller. 😇
@shriya_saran1109 thank you
@314_anthony Many people already know about this e. Your lack of knowledge is shocking! Get informed!
Awful 😡
Love this! ❤️
@ijustine have you seen #blackfish? Not cute at alllllllll
Hi the big guy
@bjornhowl This is your business, not mine. If you don't like it, just get out of my comments. Get a life and get better informed.
Since you left WWE I love hope and am no longer watching it again
Wooooow cooool😍
The rock enjoys punching a poor white beluga
What an amazing memory to make! They truly are amazing animals! If it weren't for aquariums most people would not even know about the beautiful beluga. I wonder who that is...possibly maple 🤔

@zach_maxwell0 oh wise up you idiot, my dog is not being deprived of her natural habitat and deprived of food in order to force her to perform ridiculous, unnatural tricks and being kept from doing any of her natural behaviours with her family, beyond incomparable
@ethan.m.suli Don’t be afraid to learn and grow and change.
@britishgrumpycat not necessarily me personally, but the thousands of people who lost respect for him over this and similar posts, maybe. I certainly don't think he's going to read or care about my comment, but at least 120 other people agreed with me and that is worth the few petty (and unrelated) remarks I got in return!
Stop being so ignorant. These animals are not happy, they are prisoners 😡😡😡
Very cool!
@uptowngirl_intheheights some of these animals are 6,000 plus pounds if they don’t want to jump through the air or even come out for a show they can’t force them and have you ever worked at a place with animals they don’t deprive them of food they would die off also they are super intelligent animals which are known to beach/suicide when they are in distress or depressed they could easily jump out off the tank and do it. You prolly watched black fish and let peta get in ur head. I’m about to get a lot of hate but if you’ve never worked with them don’t talk like you know what happens behind closed doors these animals are loved for and have a unique bond with their trainers that you could probably never grasp thank u have a good day
@shriya_saran1109  I find it odd a celebrity can't go to an aquarium without being accused of something
@therock this is so disappointing. It's so sad to see celebrities you respect and admire promoting such blatant and well known cruelty. I hope that the number of people commenting the same thing will make you rethink your promotion of this place. You can't say you're in awe of these creatures while contributing to their suffering.
@derbyshiremum you won't be missed
@ellispeteellis pff no pic. Fag

@friendnamedsam
@trishmckendrick u really are a special kind of stupid if a 6000+ animals doesn’t wanna perform guess what it’s not going too and also I can tell you’ve never worked at any kind of animal facility because these animals are constantly being fed and guess what I’ve had to unload those stupid trucks full of fish they’re fresh everyday they don’t freeze them overnight and did you know they kill themselves when in distress so why don’t all these animals hop out of the aquarium
Like😘😘😘
@zach_maxwell0 you just tried to compare the life of a domesticated dog to that of a captive wild animal. I’m not going to lower myself to respond to any more of your ridiculous nonsense and ignorance. Bye Felicia
@mattwaving lol I’m not belittling you...just pointing out the hypocrisy in your profile and your comments on the rocks profile....again horse racing, riding elephants, etc is no worse than talking to a seal....also I’m trolling lol
@trishmckendrick because you can’t nice exit tho 😂😂 you got me weak af I love the ignorance of people who have never worked with animals 😂😂😂😂😂😂💀💀💀💀
@trishmckendrick didn’t dogs used to be wild 😂😴
@ajblumey jealous?

OMG WHAT A CUTIE
@streetartglobe HAHAHA
@alliejmo it's not because you're against the rock it's against YOU. Also, why do you think that Sea world  slaughters their animals? Let alone the fact that you think they rape them
@sonic2726 yeh well that’s obvious, cos you haven’t backed up a thing you’ve said, nor have you researched anything. Everything you’ve said is false. If you’re not trolling, then your a serious danger to the planet we live on. God help us all. Some of us have time to entertain your trolling and enjoy it. You have found someone who loves to do so. Like I said to you, good luck in your quest for happiness. You probably won’t find it here though. 🙏🏼
Fuck aquariums
@glaucialolli I chose to say something because I'm getting tired of these BS comments like yours.
@syoast what about zoos? And also they don't separate them from families, they were already separate and they usually heal and bond with the animals
@alliejmo also, just because it won an Oscar doesn't mean it's factual
@marioneve I was wondering where this photo of me and the rock went 😂
@theneonrunner Fuck You .. You won't be missed so fuck off
@elturborick
@skmuench what's cool about this?
@vvsdiamond_coated_heart they die in captivity really quickly
@dulce4sweet1 they die fast in captivity
@riptide42 Already doing it
Wow. Can't he do him. You dont have to agree with what he does. What are you doing to support what he likes?
Absolute moron. Disgraceful.
@therock absolutely shameless seems a lot of people thought more of you including myself, not sure how a person of your respect and influence can so shamelessly take money for animal slavery undoing so much hard work and dedication, absolutely disgusting
@ethically_elizabeth lmao their water isn’t chlorinated if it was they would be dead in a day
Beluga whales are amazing 😍 . It's great you had the chance to get in contact with one of the animals at this accredited and certified facility. Modern zoos and aquariums are important for education, conservation and research. Thanks for supporting @georgiaaquarium - one of the best zoological facilities in the world.
@haven.varcoe I’m a marine biologist with 25 years experience of whales and dolphins. I know what I am talking about: these whales have come from the wild. How else would they get into the concrete tanks? It is not illegal to catch wild cetaceans for display in US waters but states have declined to grant licences to  SeaWorld and their ilk doing it because it’s 1) cruel and 2) bad for the environment. So animals were caught from Russia, bred and sold on. GA has a history of failed pregnancies and still births and as recently as 2015 was considering replenishing their stock with wild caught Russian beluga. This is a matter of public record.

"@sonic2726 for once you are correct, Thailand is renowned for doing those things which is why I chose this SANCTUARY to go to, where they don’t do any told thee things and try and change the way Thailand looks upon these creatures. If you research it, you’ll gain some knowledge on it.
They’re not friendly to humans, they are wild animals, they just know that they are being helped, so they allow us to be close to them. They are left to do as they please, and allow humans to walk with them in their natural habitat, which is a huge jungle where you can spend time with them and admire their beauty.  If you don’t believe me, the go there yourself, help them recover, and do some good in the world instead of berating others who are doing nice things for animals, and trying to make the world a better place. Trying to belittle people only shows a weakness and an insecurity within yourself. Good luck in your own search for happiness. 🙏🏼"
@instagangstafor_real I don't actually own one. Care to purchase me one so I can?? I would preferably start off small I don't need any bells or whistles in terms of vibrations or extra settings. DM me for my PO box! 😘😘
Might as well be @j_stot117 beluga for life 😂🤙🏽
This is an aww moment
@therock I wanted to let you know the reason why I have unfollowed you.... I’m sure you will not be bothered in the slightest... but it’s not because I don’t like you. I have respected you as a human being and an actor for so long. You were always one of the good guys in my books. Our family think you’re brilliant as an actor but my reason is simple..... I do not agree with animals in captivity. I was so disappointed to see that you had posed with a Beluga recently, an Orca in the past, sea lions and others. You have kids.... do you ever wonder where the family of these animals are?. How they were captured?, or where their family members were captured. Have you watched Blackfish? You must have?. The Cove?. Please, take a look at these incredible docus and tell me that they belong in tanks for our entertainment, for a photo! 😢✌🏼🐳🐬🌊 #wildandfree #theresnobeautyinstolenfreedom #blackfish #thecove #dolphinproject

Pretty dolphin
@linpeanuts yeah and they’ll die if you release them
😘😘😘😘😘
@gregor_mac76 hey you fuck he’s enjoying a day at the aquarium with his family that doesn’t mean he supports animal cruelty
You just found your soul mate balt head great body good sense of humor it will be great if you two work well together
@carissageorgia Animals shouldn't be kept in captivity anywhere or used for entertainment. If these people keep the animals in a tank instead of their own and bigger environment, it's so wrong and cruel!
UNFOLLOWING.
Awesome hh
& such a shame it's captive. 🤬
That is a beautiful Dolphin not to mention the rock is cute also.
dolphin - fuck the aquaman!!is the @therock ock
@314_anthony No, I expect people to respect these sentient beings and do not go to these places that use animals for entertainment and keep them in small tanks outside of their own environment. It's so wrong and cruel! We should support animals freedom and well-being.
Ainnnnn sou doida para ver uma Beluga desperto!!!! Elas são simplesmente lindas!!!!!
Hermoso😍
That guy is the coolest!😍😍😍🙏
Super
Terrible. How can anyone think watching any animal perform or entertain is acceptable in 2018? I went to Florida in 1991 when I was 14, and was against seeing Sea World and still against the cruelty now. Animals are not entertainment. Let them live their lives in peace, not in a cage/aquarium 😪.
@inkdchik27 he is the #1 movie star in the world. He has a lot of influence on people. So yes, people are right to criticise him (constructively). What he does, others follow. There’s a responsibility there, one he often cites. So he’s going to be good with this, he likes dialogue and discussion
Sort of proportions in the 2 heads  great minds
دلفین عزیزم
@cajun_pinoy You know nothing and throw out random accusations, you sound like an idiot. Goodbye!
@chasey_123 victims of the system that literally brought them into the world. I'm not so sure I would rather be born into a system that exploits me from the day I'm born than be free to make my own life (and yes, likely because I haven't been taught how to indulge in my natural instincts such as hunting - I would die). But yes, by all means, let's just keep breeding more animals in cages because it's better to live than die no matter the cost to quality of life. Right? 🙈
I love you Dwane

Why you punch it though!? 😁😝

Wow
I wish i fist pumped that 😣👊✊🙈☹☹👦
You are a great man I love you so much try to give me an invite to your place
Why does it look like @therock is punching the whale. Oh wait he is hurting the whale by promoting these interactions with whales. In turn cause more to be held captive.
@therock If they don't already know it you should download the song Baby Beluga for your girls. My kids loved it when they were little and would sing it to the whales at Sea World when we went
Really cool

You're the shit rock. But these guys and killer whales are doped up on massive amounts of Xanax and valium and go insane behind closed door hurting themselves and others. #stillcool ?

@therock please consider using your platform to educate others and end animals in captivity, eg: sea world and zoos. Look at the bigger picture, not your paycheck.
@kittiegrahamfusion if they are unable to go back to the Wild then appropriate tanks (10000x larger) should be built at a sanctuary. They shouldn’t be living in such horrible conditions being made to ‘work’ for their food.  Primarily ... they should have never been born in captivity. So many of these precious creatures have died due to inappropriate living conditions. This is not ok.
Mdrrrr @aselo_ika
They're even more beautiful in the ocean
Nice one 👏👍
......
Bitterly disappointed that you condone these intelligent sentient beings living in nothing more than bathtubs.
awesome
Shame on you. Captivity kills.
@dcdivine1 lol 😂❤️❤️
Our Beluga whale friend is unwillingly in captivity. Here we see @therock, who has chosen to keep his mind is in captivity.  Supporting an organization that robs animals from their natural habitat in the name of profit is not only disappointing but SICK. What a shame.
This is so disgusting. I’m so sad that you’re advocating this. Unfollowed and hugely disappointed. I thought you were one of the good ones.
@therock Ugh..super bummed that you’re supporting captivity.  Please don’t support the slavery of these sentient beings - Watch ‘Born to be free’, The Cove (OSCAR winner by the way)and Blackfish.  Please learn about the horrific truths about cetacean captivity .
🐋🐋🐋🐋🐋Whales for life
Know the feeling. I’d still would love to do marine biology those whales and dolphins are amazing. Even in the wild some are still so friendly and even known to help us.

@therock this is just awesome. I’ve been dying to do some of the @georgiaaquarium back stage experiences, especially the scuba diving option but I haven’t been back to ATL in two years. It’s about time I go back. As for the PETA people who are mad that you “support animal captivity”, they can go kick rocks.
Ooooooo
It's probably thinking the same about you
@melie_mt no mate is my 4 language!
Follow me😉
Just went down in my estimation. An intelligent man in your position shouldn't be promoting the captive slavery and cruelty of aquariums. How can you think this is ok? Please reconsider their plight and support stopping the captivity of intelligent species that deserve better from the human race.

@birdslayeggs what part of Bkackfish is not factual? And I ask as a cetacean biologist with years of experience of whales and dolphins. They were wild caught ✅ the animals were misunderstood ✅ SeaWorld covered up failings ✅ Tili killed 3 people ✅ OSHA banned SeaWorld from in water work ✅ what’s false? That aquaria and zoos perform a huge role in education, research and conservation is without doubt, but all zoos have moved on and evolved as we learned more about the animals we keep.
great shot
@melie_mt you are another loser? Because seen that you guys just talk with the double morality of social media! Or you guys are just the van wagon crew! 🤔

Cover up the whole your thing in
Disgusting.  A beautiful intelligent creature,  being patronized by @therock . You should hide your head on shame for condoning this life sentence of pure misery,
Wow this comment section is a mess. Most people do not have a clue what they are talking about, these animals were not captured from the wild, it's illegal in the US. They are well taken care of, with enrichment and enough food and exercise. Do your research before commenting PLEASE.
That is good capture
Nooooooooooooooo  not in captivity !!!!!

Nice
Awesome! Wiab J could fist bump a Beluga Whale ❤️So glad there are places where the injured animals can be cared for. In the wild they are hunted by humans for their blubber and yet there are still people who think that is the best place for them! It's a shame they can't understand that humans hurting them are the reason these animals are in a "place like this" SMH

I love beluga whales and you you’re very inspirational and awesome ♥️🐬
Great 👍👍👍
@celestialkittylover actually no ... a whale life is so short in captivity compared to living in their natural habitat look at orcas they live maybe to 13 in captivity and out on he ocean males to 60 and females can live to 100 ... they starve the whales to preform tricks , the whales skin burns because they are too close to the surface of the water .. their fins start to fall need me to go on. ?

Que lindo essa foto
@vigilante_vegan I was hoping you might have the connections and influence to steer him towards a better path. Or maybe you can give me some advice on how we can better reach these influential people rather than just roughing them up in social media comment sections.
@therock gone fucked up
Rampage 2?! 😁
@jensau26 you make absolutely no sense at all. This is about cruelty in keeping house pets in captivity where we cannot replicate the conditions they would live in if they were wild (the Streets). Has absolutely no bearing on house pets or plants.
@birdslayeggs are you kidding me ... they starve the whales to make they preform tricks , the whales skin is burnt from being in a tank where they can’t get down enough away from the sun they paint over this with black zinc oxide .. the whales are drugged when they act up .. they are fed gelatin to prevent dehydration because they don’t get the proper food / living in chlorine water ... which is not natural , they force them into breeding with family members and in the wild they pick their mates ... they are not healthy their dorsal fins have collapsed from poor care and not enough space to swim ... and that’s places are good ? Hahaha
Rrallll
@theneonrunner you WON'T BE MISSED!

OMGSH if you’re in GA I would do anything to meet you 😩 I grew up in Bethlehem, PA and you’ve always been an inspiration ❤️
@therock This beautiful animal with staggering intelligence does not belong in a tank posing for pictures or for entertainment!  #degrading to the intelligence of this beautiful being! These animals belong in the wild NOT in captivity. Think about where this Beluga came from? Please use your celebrity platform to encourage anti captivity & respect for all animals. Learn more here—-> @dolphin_project & Encourage your followers to pledge not to buy tickets to aquariums & #dolphin shows #endcaptivity #emptythetanks
@saturnoay never even mentioned you stop asking for attention
😍😍😍😍😍
@therock these animals are captured from their natural habitat just to be enclosed in a very small pool. @oceanicpreservationsociety follow then to become more educated on what really happens when you support this industry.

Cool guy
Noooo @therock Just say NO! I love your movies and following you on IG... this is terrible. Whales should not be kept in tanks!!
@dragongamer_67 no it is not the same, the difference is dogs have been domesticated over thousands of years. These whales are born in the wild and captured to be placed into tiny tanks for our amusement, they are not domesticated. They are wild animals. Not only that but they are highly intelligent, social and emotional animals and often will show abnormal or “stereotypic” behaviour because they cannot cope with the stress of being in a small tank. Their tanks have no enrichment or stimulation. These animals are placed in artificial family groups and as a result will become aggressive with one another. There are so many things wrong with this. This is nothing like keeping a dog as a pet. Please check out the film Blackfish, it will surely change your mind.
One of the greatest man
@veganmagick No, they labeled themselves as a documentary which a documentary is suppose to show both sides. I’m neutral captivity which means I can understand both sides but I know people who do not support this industry at all and believe that PETA and Blackfish are not the most reliable resources. Research does more justice than watching one movie. I’ve been supporting SeaWorld in specifically before Blackfish and the backlash against SeaWorld so I have had multiple years to condone research about the well-being of the animals.
So cute
@karalucasphotography Do a google search for “Georgia Aquarium denied permit to import beluga whales” and you’ll find what you’re looking for.
its too cool and its too cute

Shouldn't be held captive...😥
So disappointed ! !! Whales dolphins orcas ... are not made to be in tanks . So disappointed that you love that.  I love beluga too but you can see them in tge wikd too where they live with their families .
AWSOME!!!!!! Is that real? 🤩
@a.rod.86 😩
Oh this feed gonna anger the snowflake brigade!!! #snowflake
@msz_grayy that is so cool!!! Its in Georgia?! Was that where the whale sharks were??? I thought it was hawaii
@karalucasphotography Glad to hear that.  They are beautiful creatures.
@riptide42 Places like Georgia Aquarium have noticed that they should not have captured animals and stopped many many years ago. Most of the animals in managed care actually are bred and because of people like you - they have been stopping that. The Rock is publicly stating that from what he has seen, he believes they are in good care.
🤬
Beautiful animal
Loving this Rock Man! #bethsdabodyworks.com
Amazing the rock
Amazing 👌👌👌👌
If you love whales please don't exploit them in this way as it gives people the idea that this is okay! This beautiful intelligent beings do not want to live in a cage or prison, they want to live freely with eachother! Just think about how you would feel if you were stuck in a tiny cage with another species constantly touching you without your own kind. If you have any respect for this poor animal please take this photo down and visit sanctuarys that rescue rehabilitate and often are able to re release them to their NATURAL HABITAT
@michele_dey no it’s in Atlanta
Well  do a movie  I would  watch  so beautiful
@the_halestorm Yeah, that checks out. What a life that whale is living.
@shahriarsaviour
@karalucasphotography They did try to purchase new belugas a few years ago, but were denied the sale by the government.  They have been forced to change, which is good, but it wasn’t voluntarily.  I appreciate your respectful dialog, by the way.  Says a lot about you.
It's very very cute❤😍

The only ones complaining are overly sensitive women. That's why women don't belong in the battle field with the men. They wouldn't be able to handle the reality of war. Women belong in the kitchen like god intended.
Why are you enjoying punching a Beluga? Come one Rock, you're better than that

@karalucasphotography On Sept. 28, 2015 an appeal to import 18 Beluga Whales from Russia was denied by a Federal District Court for the Georgia Aquarium.
@valelemari. Yooo 💀

What a great learning experiance and assume for you to share this. This institution does much to help the animals and for you to show  these incredible pictures -very generous of you.
I love your films and would have considered myself a fan, but with you advocating the slavery of animals I just can't continue to support you.
Watch Blackfish....you’ll never go to an aquarium again.
Cute
These two got the same peanut ass head 😂😂😂😂
@mattwaving no clue what your saying. I asked a question how many people in Atlanta knew what a beluga whale was before the aquarium? I didn’t make a statement??!!
woowwwwwww

Another beautiful creature held captive against it's will for the sake of a selfie. Would you want to be trapped in a smartcar with no escape for your entire life just so somebody gets a moment of amusement and a CEO gets richer? Please watch Blackfish.

I love that you love this beautiful animal. I grew up in Hawaii like you, surrounded by amazing sea life where it belongs, in the ocean. I believe you meant no harm with this post but please know that others will follow in your lead because of your influence and remove it. #EmptyTheTanks #WhalesBelongWithFamily #EndCaptivity
This is awful...please dont support these places @therock #captivitykills
Now if you could only use your influence to set them free....what a sight that would be.
@luizcezar1002 que lindo vocesss KKKKKKKKK
Mijito ricoooo
Es algo sorprendente ..huaauuu
😄
Awwww ❤️❤️❤️
That is cool
@karalucasphotography That’s false. These animals were either stolen from their families in the ocean and sold to this aquarium, or they were captive bred from whales stolen from their families in the ocean and then once bred are ripped from their parents and sold to this aquarium. How can you try and justify that?  They are trained to perform (like it is doing for @therock in this photo) for food, which is depressing and cruel and instead of roam the open ocean it is living its entire life in a bathtub so humans can be entertained.  I’m sorry if you feel that supporting this form a slavery is a good use of The Rock’s powerful voice, but millions of us don’t and hope he will make this a teachable moment.  Let’s do better.
Awesome
Twinning 🤞🏾☺️
Years later that Beluga Whale will press charges on @therock for assault... Welcome to 2018 😂 😂 😂 #therockwassetup #lies #igotyourback
@karalucasphotography what a coincidence that any documentaries  that exposes big corrupt and exploitative businesses end up being labelled as "propaganda" how convenient it must be to just label it that rather than taking a look at your own views and questioning the use of animals ad entertainment. 😉
@sonic2726 no I don’t know. Tell me.

@nishhboo yaa first I thought egu real nay 😍
I really hope that all those people complaining about captivity don’t have “pets” at home.... 🧐
Let them free. They are in jail.
@riptide42 Hmm I taste salt...
@sonic2726 what did you find out? I’m intrigued. You’re obviously have a wealth of knowledge of the elephants there, having read it on google for 10 mins.
It's a luck whale 🐳🤞
❤❤
He looks just like you !
That is so Flippin cool
@riptide42 I don’t profit off of any of my photos. I do it as a hobby rather than for financial status.
Jesus people, he's having a family outing and you're attacking him for "supporting animal captivity"? Did he say "all animals should be held captive". No. And am I supporting it too then because I have a cat and dog that are "stuck in captivity" in my house with food and not out in the streets starving like when I found them at near death? Or everyone else who has a dog? Also, some aquariums rescue wild life and they have to live in captivity because they are not strong enough to return to the wild and would die. Aquariums also help us understand these beautiful creatures more. Yes, some aquariums and zoos lose animals as they get sick but how about we focus more on the mass shootings first before we tackle watching wildlife behind glass. Now leave the man alone who donates his time and money and works incredibly hard and always makes time for his family. #trueman @therock
Hey Rock will  you return to WWE

@tschlenkr lol stalk? I always like to see what idiot is talking to me.
@riptide42 These animals are not forced to do anything and if he did not believe that he would not be publicly supporting it. From what I have seen he got to have a full experience and see how these animals are cared for.

@shriya_saran1109 lmao
@sweat.eat.travel.live wow thank you for treating me like a human and yes I understand but I see nothing wrong with breeding In captivity. But a 6,000 pound intelligent mammal isn’t going to be doing tricks or jump through hoops if they don’t want too. Also I’m talking specifically about seaworld those animals are spoiled and loved for. Believe it or not when they are stressed or depressed they will beach themselves so they know they could kill themselves but they don’t. I recommend never watching black fish because it’s not factual I’ve seen the in and outs of seaworld and it’s amazing the bond between the creatures and trainers is simply beautiful. Also you can’t understand the real beauty of these animals on YouTube.
Damn you look like twins, just a bit less tanned 😜. Same haircut and build
OMG! Stop! I feel like I'm looking into the SUN! #2awesome
Can y’all all shut the fuck up? Your comment is not gonna change the past nor is it gonna change anything. sorry but not only do i think y’all’s comments are bullshit but so is the negativity he is getting. He’s a great guy and so what, he goes to an aquarium with his kids and now he’s a bad person. No. Get tf out of here
Thank you for supporting amazing facilities like the Georgia Aquarium. The impact facilities like this have on the knowledge and conservation of these animals cannot be stated enough. 🙌🏼🐳
Awesome photo.  Would love to visit this aquarium and see the whale sharks there too.
Beautiful.  Picture
@sweat.eat.travel.live also is it wrong to have cats and dogs or a pet fish it’s the same concept just smaller animals
@therock I know you are a sympathetic person. It would be great if you discourage keeping belugas in the aquariums in the first place instead of promoting that. I would recommend that you watch black fish.
Bjudifoll
Nooo. Please have you seen the death toll at this place!? They have a hard time keeping Belugas alive there, because they don't belong there. Please send a better message.
Это прекрасно!!
Wauuuuu
You totally Rock! Always have, always will. Keep doing you!

@408.destiiny I think your message got taken way out of context and what I get from what you were trying to say is that injured animals need to be rehabilitated in sanctuary not in these hell holes. I think people may have gotten the message that you support these kinds of places which I don't think you do from reading your messages. It is an odd placement of the message considering the context of the picture so I can see where people may have jumped to conclusions. All aquariums are for profit only where the animals are only worth the income they generate. I used to believe in the conservation lie these places perpetuate to the public but it is in fact all lies. Sorry if you felt attacked. Speak up for animals  always ✌️
Amazing...

@mattwaving buuuuut we only see things the way we see fit sometimes
@shriya_saran1109 👐🏼 true
@zach_maxwell0 i recommend researching what happens in tajin every year. Go check out @dolphin_project  Rescued animals are usually rehabilitated and released into the wild if it’s possible. Zoo animals need rescuing in a lot of places! Check out zoos in Venezuela where the animals were starving earlier this year. Zoos in countries where wars are happening like Syria. They are left without care or food. Non for profit organizations end up stepping up and going to these places to bring the animals to safety. Lots of places are nice and animals are taken care of but it still doesn’t make it right to keep and breed them in captivity. Why are we Humans exploiting other living being for our amusement? Can’t afford to go to Africa to see a giraffe or a lion? Google the pictures and watch some videos on YouTube. We have access to so many resources to educate ourself. Going to the zoo does nothing more then hurting the animals that we are claiming to protect.
If you love these beautiful creatures so much, why support the place where they’re held captive and forced to perform and have been stolen from their homes in the ocean, where they belong! Really disappointing😪💔

Rock an idol like you should not associate your image with a crime like  these. Freedom to all animals!
@kylerh08 i had no idea you got your panties so bunched up you had to stalk my page. Flattered but no thanks.
@sonic2726 not an elephant park, a sanctuary for injured elephants. No breeding programme, just rescues that are re released. No tourists. People who work there for free. I’ve already said that. If I drew a picture, would it make it easier to understand? Again, making up scenarios.
@sonic2726 doesn’t matter what anyone else that goes there thinks, they’re as worthless as the comments. My comments are true though, that’s where we differ.
@edwinjvrivera 😍
They don't belong in captivity.  They deserve better... you lost respect from many I know...including myself.  I'll pass on any future movies you make.
So cool!
@carolswigsbrazil não eram os gêmeos? Kkkkkkkkkkk

Boo! Don't support captive sea life!
Wow is everyone with some notoriety now supposed to champion every cause that you people think is an offense or a crime??? It is an aquarium!! Some of the animals there are not able to survive in the ocean. Others are in danger of extinction, and the aquarium performs crucial research and reports information that can save some species. No it is not their native habitat, but we cant always go home!!!
So sad. Why can't you put your money into setting them free in protected waters.
Omg, thats just awesome✌😎🤘

And so very true very very true!
Sweet!
I love you man , but I hope you agree we should free all animals that belongs in the wild. Money or not, they should not be our entertainers
@kbelcher15 We who work in the film industry know about a magic trick called visual effects!  CGI animals!  Can you believe we can make movies without abusing animals?!?! My world is wondrous and awesome because of all the life I share this planet with.  Stop supporting the slavery of sentient beings.  You’re complicit.
Que belleza 😍😲
@ethically_elizabeth what’s sad is all the people who go nuts over animals in aquariums but most of those people don’t care a lick about innocent babies Murdered everyday. Makes perfect sense
Lindo
@cajun_pinoy You really understand nothing ?! Did you have a brain ? If the earth was without humans it will be much better for ALL the rest of the word, animals, plants, EVERYTHING and then I have no difficulties to see that your a fucking poison to this world.
@star__666 lol no. I love aquariums. Visit them frequently. Most of the animals there are either born there or rescued from a dire situation, not actively stolen from a healthy situation with their mothers.
👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 Rocking Rock Rocks
@mattwaving how many people in Atlanta knew what a beluga whale was before the aquarium? Give me a figure? ......I’m all ears? If you make these statements you need to back them up👂🏼👂🏼

@jensau26 hahahaha yep all looney left lunatics... and I know that you don’t or you would have put yours amongst that list..... the only groups I support is those support defenseless children who are trafficked every day.  But you don’t care about them do you?  Because there not smart like whales.....
This is a joke and for anyone who thinks it isn't it is WATHS INTWellAGWINCE 😂😂
Your so cool and inspirational!!!!!!! Definitely my favorite actor! @therock also everyone tells me I look like Moana 😂
Love your sense of humor!

@mattwaving lol I’m still gonna go watch them...swim
Follow me
Thank you for supporting Zoos & aquariums!!!!! Your support helps us take care of all animals in zoological care and in the wild!!!💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
@kalamityjs Hahahaha.  Guess what???? News Flash!!!! Your a Human too.... so why don’t you prove to us that if humans didn’t exist the world would be a much better place..... 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wow that is beautiful
@mattwaving your comments are just as worthless cuz nobody who goes to see these animals gives two sh*ts what you think 😂
This is like one of those memes .. "your first day at the gym & you're meeting your trainer"  haha
@ethically_elizabeth no animal at any aza accreditation facility force there animal to perform they get there food regardless!! But we strive to make each environment as fun and enriching as possible. They also act as animal ambassadors for their species in the wild! To help people make an impact💙
@kalamityjs and yes I’m smarter than you think... because you didn’t know your being trolled.... thanks for the laughs🤣🤣🤣🤣
@mattwaving ohhh and that elephant park you speak of has a huge breeding program...not just rescues...then guess what those elephants get turned into profit for tourist wanting to take a stroll with them 🤷‍♂️
U lost a fan today😡
damn
🍑🍑🐸🐸
Nice 👍
@jayne_centurion a lot of those animals were injured and cannot function out in the wild anymore so they use them to educate the public.
@felipothehippo206
Hahahaha
@mattwaving pretty sure that wasn’t a wild elephant you were petting either hypocrite
Gross. Whales don’t belong in bathtubs. Disappointed in you.
Awww!!! Its Bailey. @msz_grayy
Be sure to grab your 4ocean bracelet from the gift shop before you leave 😉🐋🐳
Genuinely shocked you would promote captivity of these beautiful beings!!! #emptythetanks
@flynnpictureco every time humans remove them from their family, it causes death and destruction to the rest of the pod. Cetaceans in captivity live shorter lives and are often diseased. They don’t belong in tanks. If people want to help, donate to wild conservation groups and stop supporting zooquariums.
@mdaikman brings me back to me you and Sophster at the Aquarium! These guys were my favorite

You're seriously a good dude mr. Johnson, I'm a barber at Dave's barber shop in Fort Myers Florida. And I was just talking to a fellow Fitness friend of mine and we both agree you're just a good guy thank you for what you do
wonderfull i like belugas 💞
While you may never read this, I’ll go ahead anyway. Please don’t promote parks that hold these magnificent, intelligent creatures for our entertainment. They should be free in the oceans where that are meant to be.
Ok, @therock , you need to stop being All Sexy Like! (Said no one eva.) 💋
Ha ha just look at this beautiful animal in a cage he shall be my new co-star so I can make money off of him. #coolstorybro

@cajun_pinoy How do you know that I don't? There are plenty of well established organisations that campaign to end keeping dolphins and whales in captivity. Try @dolphin_project @seashepherd @whales_org @bornfreefoundation for a start.
My hero......nice
@riptide42 so there should be no animals in movies either? What a boring world you would live in. Do you speak to animals? Did they tell you they hate this? Maybe they are actually happy not spending their lives running from predators
Amazing picture
@yenifer_mdc ❤️😍😘
Captivity is inhumane and its irresponsible for a person of your stature to support it. Do some research. Those animals are not happy to be paraded around for show they need to be in the wild where they belong.
😍
Beautiful pic
🐬🐬😍😘😍😘😍😘
Can’t wait
@sonic2726 it was wild elephant that was in rescue sanctuary for elephants that have stood on land mines. They are helped back to fitness, taught how to walk again and released back into the wild. I worked there voluntarily for a while. Don’t comment on things you know nothing about. Facts my friend is what is true, you can’t argue a fact, guess work is what you’re going on, which is why your comments are worthless, un researched, and incorrect at best.

I hope one day you realize how dumb and stupid you look supporting the abuse, captivity of beings that not only deserve to be in their environment with their families but that is where we need them to be if we want a planet in balance for future generations. Stop using your celebrity to promote pain, destruction and outdated ideas. Shame on you and on #georgiaaquarium

So nice rock
Countless species of animals would be extinct if it weren’t for zoos and aquariums!! Please know that true wildlife conservationists, people who are ACTUALLY doing real boots-on-the-ground conservation work, not just sitting behind a keyboard spewing hate fueled by misinformation, support accredited zoos and aquariums and know the true meaning of conservation! Thank you Dwayne!
@_claud_ia_ that is so cool. Now I want to go lol
@mattwaving *reckon
yeah
Totally Awesome. What a opportunity!🤔🤗
Ai @geycevilasboas , ele conheceu meus familiares rs
@mattwaving the whale in the tank is there to inspire people to want to go into marine biology fields, raise interest in the animals, etc etc....how many people in Atlanta knew wtf a beluga whale was before the aquarium 🤣
Looks good
AMAZING PICTURE!!!
@marcus1908 olha aí a beluga! Parece seu dedão do pé

Free him !

@malachim1102 because I’m assuming that you’re smart enough to understand that you do not need to do that to survive, unlike a lion, who has no other option. You are able to live off of a vegan die and be healthy, a lion is not.

"Without freedom there is no reason to exist!
⤵
Zoos have taken away the animals' freedom and made them living skeletons. The pride is gone. The will to thrive has vanished. The feeling of happiness faded. The thrill of endless miles of roaming has been usurped. Every thing that is natural to an animal, has been made UNNATURAL by the state-sanctioned animal prison system that operates for one reason and one reason alone: the almighty dollar. Please don't be a part of this Dwayne. #blackfish #thecove #earthlings 🐬🐋🐠🐟🐡"
i love whals
@therock🥊 .. Wth Really?!! 🐬🐋🤦🏻‍♀️Shameful disgusting ‘IGNORANCE’ all for entertainment and likes :( can’t believe you’d promote ‘Captivity’ just to make your day!! look into what happens behind closed doors when you and all alike leave these hell holes🤬 please don’t promote cruelty for your damn self pleasure at a severe cost to theirs!!! #emptythetanks #captivitykills #ignorance #suffering #dolphins #tanks #why #suffering #educate 💔🐬🐋
Cool 😎 fist bump 🤜
Don't support whales in captivity. Period.💚
Diossss que hermosuraaaaa
Wow
Dont support jailing of aninals :(
@therock captivity is cruel. In captivity whales and dolphins live shorter lives than they do in the wild even though they are kept in an environment that is free of predators and other threats that they face in the wild. In the wild they can swim up to 100 miles a day but in a small tank they have very little space in which to move around and so suffer stress, and display unnatural behaviour. The captive environment can never replace their natural one. #endcaptivity
Is it an albino?
#emptythetanks 🚫🚫🐋🐬🐟🐳🦈🐡🦀🦐🦑🐙

@tschlenkr how can you tell someone is a vegan? Don’t worry they’ll tell u as soon as you meet
@tschlenkr They really don’t get it. Entitlement doesn’t allow them to understand that they are participating in a cruel slave trade.
Awesome 😁 love it 😘
Aww
@jayne_centurion I love y'all social media activists.. you're really doing something..🤡
@jensau26 Hahahaha...... if your so passionate about whales,  maybe you should put that passion against the whaling industry instead of Aquariums.... from the looks of it,  the Aquariums aren’t treating the animals bad and they don’t have to worry about predators.... but your just like the rest of the 99.9% of the keyboard warriors... all talk and no walk... Do you have a website of your passion to save the whales?  YouTube Vlog explaining all the bad things the Aquariums are doing to the whales??? If you don’t have any of these then how are we to take you serious???
The eocks superpower is to talk with porpoises
Show!
Wow! How freaking cool!
Two orcas just have been captured in Russia! Volunteers on the ground are Being assaulted with weapons by fishermen. They want to prevent volunteers from documenting cruel captures! Please reconsider your involvement and support to Georgia Aquarium who had direct involvement with Russian whale traders and tried to import 18 wild caught belugas from Russia - watch documentary “Born to be Free” on Netflix!
@shriya_saran1109 sorry but what exactly have you done to save beluga whales? It doesn’t matter if he goes to the aquarium or not, they will still be making profit. You wanna do something about it go represent with peta or some shit because whether you like it or not animals will still be used for peoples entertainment, not to say that I agree with it either but there’s very little that we can do against industries such as these
I love you but please don't support marine life such as intelligent whales being kept in captivity it's cruel they starve them to make them do tricks and then reward them with food please support say no to captivity
@niuyoh YO
@dd_martinez81 😂😂😂😂

wow @therock so dissapointed , I genuinly thought you would do good with the amount of people you reach out to - captivity for these poor animals is hell - and the way in which they are captured , exploited and sold is horrific - all for a bit of entertainment - shame on you #boycottseaworld #freedolphins #animalcruelty
@ethically_elizabeth I agree with this... I don’t support what is going on in this picture. Whales don’t belong in captivity and it shouldn’t continue happening.
Hey you told me I was gonna be in your next movie as the Comic relief
Looks like the weekly SJW meeting is now focused on the Rock and some other bs they pretend to be mad about. Instead of raging on social media, go to work and be a productive member of society. Fuck, I wish I had the time to wake up and decide what to be angry about instead of going to work!
So cutey
@therock, as an actor I assume you watch movies that you don’t feature in? Here’s two for your watchlist - #blackfish and #thecove. Please educate yourself
I think it’s The Rock that’s star struck this time!

@glaucialolli you should probably do your research on the Georgia Aquarium and how the government decides to keep an animal in “captivity”.

@hayleebrookekennedy right??
@haulinboats I can’t open the link, but I understand the conservation perspective. That’s huge trophy hunters who take down elephants/cheetahs/lions justify their hunts when people are outraged. The majority of the animals at Seaworld are not on the brink of extinction- most of them are purchased from Japanese/Russian trappers who go out and rip these animals from their pods and then sell them for a profit. Its not noble or conserving anything. And while I guess it’s good that whatever zoo the article is talking about (again, can’t open the link), saved a species from extinction, the problem of WHY these animals are on the brink of extinction (human activity, hunting, poaching, pollution) isn’t solved when zoos step in.
There's always that one that has something to say but I guarantee you she's not doing a damn thing to help those situations she speaks of. Don't just talk about it, be about it.. Physically do something about it but until then.. just be quiet bc from here it just seems like negativity
What's the next movie?
Wow
@shriya_saran1109 two orcas just have been captured in Russia! Volunteers on the ground are Being assaulted with weapons by fishermen. They want to prevent volunteers from documenting cruel captures! Please help us bring international attention to this important cause!

Hell yeah
WTF?  Why would you promote this?  I thought you would be a little more about conservation and animal rights rather than promoting capturing Beautiful Creatures and essentially putting them in a prison for people to stare at.  You can change lives,  animal or human,  use this power wisely.

All you cry baby idiots make me laugh. Let the man have a day at the aquarium and learn some stuff about animals that you'll likely never see out in the wild. Mind your own business. I suppose all you clowns never eat fish, right? And don't say the whale is not a fish, I know that but you idiots want the fish released too. All of you, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, STFU

@saraaaaaa.g_
@shriya_saran1109 you do realize that some animals are taken from un safe environments and kept safely here. Some animals in aquariums are the only ones left of their kind, would you then want to send them into the environment to make become extinct. I agree that some aquariums treat their animals unkindly but most workers have degrees in the animals they care for and actually care about the animals they take care of.
Fuck all you losers blaming him lol y’all Can suck a dick
They need to be in the wild not in an aquarium!!
Poor animal is in captivity.😢
Wow❤❤👍👍💪💪
You are stronger; BTW, @kevinhart4real KHart would be offended if you now co-star @m_phelps00 Michael Phelps here, all white and good swimmer... help me, help me... nigga!
Awwwwn cute dolphin...
@bradleyabi not all aquariums are bad, most take hurt or endangered animals away from unsafe environments. Having them in these aquariums brings awareness to their terrible outside world conditions and urges people to stop littering and throwing stuff in the ocean.
@streetartglobe 😂
@streetartglobe 😂
Set it free !!! This is bad
I want one!
I have no doubt that the aquarium does great work, but this image is fuel on the flames of the live capture industry in Russia and China. Please use your image for good: https://www.peta.org/blog/pamela-anderson-urges-president-putin-call-off-orca-capture/ @pamelaanderson
My sweet only celebrity I follow this post saddens me they are in captivity - this is not a happy whale u should not be promoting their captivity they belong in the wild

@cajun_pinoy Oh give it a rest!! You know nothing about me or what I do and yes, one day, there will be no whales and dolphins held in captivity. Do some research about these amazing creatures and then you won't sound like such an idiot!
When did he support? Don't be a brainless fans🙄
What a nice guye
Awesome! It looks like you made a new friend as animals are AWESOME! They can always tell if someone is a good person and you definitely are a great person and role model for everyone bro! I hope to meet you and shake your hand one day and tell you that in person because the world needs more people like you especially with all the craziness going on in this country and the world...keep up the great work and affecting positive change in the world!

All the people who are bitching about @therock supporting animal captivity really got to get over themselves and get a life. Guess you can't have a dog apt a goldfish because that is animal captivity, bunch of assholes
So disappointed that you posed with a captive mammal. They are intelligent and beautiful creatures who do not deserve to be torn from their families and used for human entertainment.

@cajun_pinoy maybe read what I wrote before commenting next time. Might not make such an ass out of yourself. You’ve managed to agree with me, whilst trying to argue, and put across the same point that I already have. You have just proved your intelligence level is below that of a whale. Let’s put you in a tank for life. Don’t think many people would come and pay to see you though......maybe not.

Haha, thats mint brother
Love you 😍😍
@shriya_saran1109 don't be an idiot.  Letting public see their beauty brings attention to them, and against whale hunting, which actually saves whale lives.  People like you hurt whales.  You need to think about what you say before you say it.
@ezdogs
Um seriously Duegons and other sea creatures are meant to be in the OCEAN not a swimming pool
@ellispeteellis wow, I don’t see what your problem is. He went to the aquarium with his family. That doesn’t automatically make him a supporter of animal captivity and cruelty.

@mirandanoel.g
@nite_puthran I’ve not mentioned the Rock at all. I was talking to you about your opinion. It’s not about being worse or not, it’s about comparing the 2. They are completely different things. To be honest, the whale would probably rather be killed than be alive in that tank for the rest of their lives. Would you rather be in jail forever or be dead? They don’t have fun in that tank bro

They are highly intelligent but you clearly are NOT for promoting aquariums and beautiful annuals kept in captivity. Shame on you.
Very disappointing.. don’t support this shit! No animal should be kept in captivity! You really need to educate yourself on this and use your voice for the better. This is cruelty.

this is sad! you with so many people following you, should not promote cruelty! captivity of such wild beauty is cruel! please educate yourself and than give a better example ! 🙏🏻 @therock
@vgil20
If you love them so much @therock you should be aware their tanks were listed as the worst for both whales and dolphins in north America. @peta you should give this some attention!
What a beautiful creature. And what a shame that a man with a huge amount of influence would also have a huge amount of ignorance. Animals like this do not belong and do not deserve to be trapped in a swimming pool performing meaningless tricks simply for our entertainment. Shame on you. Please use your platform to educate, you have power to make a change #emptythetanks @therock

@alliejmo @therock isn’t so gullible he believes that garbage. He’s wise and goes to the source to see what’s good... and champions those awesome things!
Omg he found the beluga from finding dory
@tsensation wft👀😂❤️
lovely🙀
Captifity is not OKAY you should save animals not promote cruelty to them this is very dissapointing of you.
Should be swimming in the wild 😢😡😡
This is lovely
I'm genuinely puzzled, @therock, that you can and do appreciate the awesome intelligence and beauty of these creatures, and yet are happy to not only endorse but actively promote the brutal business that is the capturing and captivity of wild cetaceans. Yes, I've been to a show...and I loved seeing the orcas. But I hadn't thought through or researched what's involved to present a show like that. Now I know better. I think you do too... I'd like to believe you don't endorse brutality and slavery. You have the power to influence millions. I don't.
I was just there Friday. Love visiting when I’m in town.
❤️❤️❤️
WOW
@cajun_pinoy It takes more than 1 person to do something about it. How do you know she’s not actively trying to make changes in the laws and push things forward for the benefit of these creatures. You know nothing about people but persist in thinking you know everything. To say you can’t do anything about it completely contradicts what you go on to say. You’ve proved that this whales intelligence level way outweighs your own in one sentence.
❤
ok but they’re not supposed to be in aquariums.
Wowza! It’s so adorable!!!! I ♥️ this picture

To all those who are offended by this...... I’m offended that you’re offended. #snowflakes. You’re making this country soft and a joke to the world. Please keep #offended opinions to yourselves.
@shriya_saran1109 you know instead of worrying about fish in the sea,  maybe you should put all of your energies towards helping the women in your country from being sexually assaulted,  and harassed.... I believe humans are 1000 times more important than animals...

@reshma.hussain02
👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽 enslaved and imprisoned whales 😞
@dad_alfie 😂😂
@nite_puthran haha buying leather bags and shoes! That’s completely the same thing as a whale in a tank. In a world where knowledge is king, you are clearly the jester! Dear oh dear. 🤦🏻‍♂️
If you did happen to make a movie with this beluga, or any other captive cetacean, I think your movie might get a whole other kind of publicity. But if,as in your world, any publicity is good publicity (the $$$, right?) then I hope and pray that same publicity will bring more of the ignorant or apathetic to understanding that this is not acceptable.
You were at the aquarium in GA and I missed you? Dang it... Oh well, this is such an amazing pic! Good job...😉👍
@clementsashley
ronaldo?
@mattwaving that’s even worse buddy .. animals are killed to get their skin .. Here the animal is alive .. and why point finger on the rock who just visited there instead of someone who built it ...
Awasome😉
U r amazing 😱
It’s a real shame you couldn’t have gone and met him in the wild where he belongs 😖 I would have thought that you’d not endorse captivity.. shame @therock I feel by posting this pic a lot of people will think it’s ok but we really need to put an end to captivity not endorse it!!
Omggg cool!😍😍
That's definitely not @kevinhart4real  bro....too tall... :/
@sonic2726 you realise how stupid that sounds. Keeping a whale in tank to raise money to stop whales being put in tanks?? Little bit counterintuitive don’t you recon?!
@sherriturpin Awe. YES! YES! YES! Miss u 2! XOXO
💕.....!
Wow👏👏❤
Rock 😊
@hearnsconor that's not a wolfin
@sammy_pat I’m not saying I agree with it - let me just start there. I just believe that it is important for the public to be educated on our marine wildlife so that this may be the last generation that see animals harmed because of our actions. Also, many of these animals were born into marine places due to our past mistakes of capturing animals for our entertainment and simply wouldn’t be able to survive in the wild. I don’t think it’s okay for these animals to be in the shows necessarily, but I do believe that having this last generation of animals to inform people for future and about past is an option that to some extent can fix our past mistakes. It’s a touchy issue and there are so many positives and negatives to it, this is just part of the way I see it.
I just find it sad that in 2018 we still find it necessary to keep other beings enslaved for our entertainment. Please, learn about these intelligent beings and what they have to endure to get to this point of entertaining you and what they go through to behind the scenes. #sonotocaptivity, #captivitykills
nice
good
And yet you are ok with it being in captivity 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Wow😍😍😍😍😍😍
@this_girls_adventures I hunt to eat sweetheart..... Go look at MacDonald's & the rest of the fast food industry b4 u look at a hunter that takes organic food for his family!
White is cool
Wow !
As happy as he looks in this photo. I think he deserves to be free in the wild❤️🙏🏼
Oh ffs man, why are you sharing pictures of animal cruelty and posing it as an 'exciting career experience'. Wake up man
@sammy_pat but to answer your question in a more direct way, some of the good things about it include recognising our mistakes and not putting more animals on parade, educating people about marine wildlife and how our environmental impact is hurting them + how to change that, showing the awe in such amazing animals so that people want to protect them in future.

The rock you are my roll model sins fast and furious gid job man
Unbelievable, Millions of people take their kid to Aquariums to see the beautiful sea animals and be educated by the visit and he’s trashed by idiot Animal rights groups. Thanks for educating and showing the kids the wonders of the Oceans

Not trying to be mean but it looks kinda fake

I love this
What the actual fuck..... this is disgusting
My love you rock
@ludacris damn good💪💪💪
Amazing an held prisoner
@ericstarchild I get it, but things like this can’t happen immediately. Many of the animals were injured or born into these places by our past mistakes. To #emptythetanks would likely result in many of them during as they simply wouldn’t survive in the wild. For now, I believe it’s important to educate the public that mistakes have been made in enslaving and parading these animals and that we need to let this be the last generations of such a thing. Further, we need to educate people about the issue while there is nothing we can do about. It’s a touchy issue and I get it if you don’t agree. I just believe there is good and bad in the situation and that while things do need to change, they can’t happen immediately.
Aquariums are uncool 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
Omg so cute😍😘
@therock too bad they are in captivity 😢. They belong in the sea....
I love u #rock

Awwww

Whaley cool
Cool
@suzmch he’s a great guy. I@ sure he just isn’t aware.
So cute 💕
@brais_ur_self but you hunt?
@jensau26 and your point?  Never called them fish.... you know what’s nice?  No matter how much you cry and your heart bleeds for them, at the end of the day there still going to be there in captivity and there’s nothing you can do about it.... if you really cared for them you’d do something about it,  but at the end of the day,  your like the rest of the 99.9% of the SJW’s,  all you do is type your complaints and that’s it.... thinking it made you feel better....
@therock  if he's a better actor than @kevinhart4real don't see why you couldn't do future films together 😂 I'll still watch them 😂😂🤙
Hey he played in finding dory lmao
@adambethyname whoah chill. They are telling the truth, you don’t have to pay attention to it if you’re that smug but don’t be rude about it.

Come on The Rock with all your power and influence. Don’t support cruelty. These incredible creatures shouldn’t be kept in captivity. Get educated dude. Show love in action & be an advocate for Liberating cetaceans from the entertainment industry. #emptythetanks

@andrewlee993 You’re stupid !! When he bring his family in this sort of park he finance this abuse !!! He just say « ok, that’s fine for me to put animal in cage and pay to see them... » and the park continue like this ! We have a responsibility to preserve animal but in there environnement ! Just try to past a week in a cage and we will see stupid !
Super pic

@kittiegrahamfusion probably you are right, but at this point there should be kind of a distinction between the structures that rehab and protect and those that make only profit life sentenced beings. Do you agree with me?
If only we knew wat it was saying.... "get me outta here"
Awww

I used to be scared of beluga whales @therock
You are a shame dude

@streetartglobe haha 😂
self-proclaimed greenpeace idiots who have no idea of ​​the situation seen in the picture, but are premature in their judgment. the main thing is to get rid of all the everyday stress on the internet. The man has done more for animals and the environment than any of you. you don't even donate 5 € or in your case 5 $ for anything. nowadays there are only hypocrites in the internet.
you really love animals
Wow
@boutdatbrycelife I did thank you and listened to one of the owners of the aquarium talking about it. But I still stand by my words here that these animals should not be confined to tiny tanks and exploited for our entertainment. I'm not blaming anyone here cause i used to go visit aquariums myself, but I know better now so I do better and try to share that message with others. It's not like that's the only documentary to watch about this kind of exploitation but it is a well known one to get an idea of what life can be like for them. You can also watch Earthlings, The Cove, Dominion and I'm sure there are loads more... I very much support anyone who is open to watching those and expanding their circle of compassion to all beings. #untilallarefree thank you ❤

I take it they invited you in to pose with this beautiful Beluga.  They have made a complete fool of you. You have just promoted the most cruel bloody trade for captivity. They should be swimming free in our oceans not swimming and posing for photos with people they earn so much money from this. So disappointed in you 😕😕😕

In captivity???? Nice embrace @therock. Surely someone of your kindness and status wouldn't be hand shaking a contained wild animal and would be fighting to set them free! FUCK SEA WORLD
The is about to cook a dolphin because The rock is always cooking.
Ohhhhh @therock this is sad to see. These incredible creatures should be in the wild with their families. It breaks my heart to see them in the confides of a tank. Don’t believe the lies that aquariums and SeaWorld tell you. This is wrong on all levels. #emptythetanks #seaworldofhurt @rickgest84 very disappointed 😔

@_rrrachaelll_ the word "ruler" has a factual definition, it's not open to interpretation, and it inherently means you think you're above the other party ,so connotations are irrelevant, and thinking you have the right to rule over animals IS disgusting arrogance

@bradleyabi I knew he was referring to you, but it was useless to mention it! Even so, no one can actually be perfect, no matter what we believe in or fight for. So keep on fighting dear, hopefully we’ll get all these horrible places closed sooner than later. Maybe, maybe, people will start to understand (a woman can dream)😅But we’re starting from very far, definitely🤦🏻‍♀️

@ijustine there is nothing cute about a social family orientated animal being stolen from its family and kept in a solitary concrete tank, fed sedatives and frozen fish to perform silly tricks for asses like @therock

It does have staggering intelligence, another reason it should not be in captivity! Go see them in the wild. So much more rewarding and incredible.

Not cool Brother 👎 Slavery is not cool at all 👎 You have such a strong voice and can be a powerful advocate for these highly intelligent animals once you do some research to realise this kind of exploitation is purely dollar driven at the animal’s expense. We all thinks it’s cute until we know more about the backstory and realise that it’s totally unacceptable from an animal welfare perspective. Please help to make a difference in their world. Thank you 🙏
with that amount of following , you should encourage your fans to not to go these sea worlds whers these innocent beings spend their life trapped , you disappoint loads of yours fans
😔💔
@massimociardi67 you can't empty tanks... seriously, a lot of these places rehab injured animals. Most can not be sent back into the wild. Those born in captivity do not have the wild instinct and will die.
@christina.posttt firstly I don’t agree that it’s propaganda. I believe it’s an easy way for eyes to be opened. I imagine most the people bashing me on here wouldn’t be willing thoroughly research the subject, so I suggested they watch a documentary is an easy way to learn a little. Perhaps you should watch The Cove if you are so against Blackfish.

@sknpetersen all your dreams come true!!!
Very disappointed @therock , these animals are not evolved to be in environments like this so they can star in a few clips in a film! There is an ignorance in most of us that are not educated in the behavioural constraints cetaceans undergo in captive situations...
Chavel ki bhawa tula😂😂😂
@amyj007 He is merely posting his visit to an aquarium, which is a public attraction. It is a shame that any animal that is perfectly healthy should be held in captivity, i am totally with you for that. But there is no point commenting negative shit to @therock because him himself did not there. He was just appreciating them. And in some cases being held in captive could be a good in a more developed. Imagine seeing a beluga whale in an aquarium in a third world country, where it isn't feed properly or cared for. He hasn't done anything what so ever wrong. I mean at least he hasn't taken drugs and gotten away with it.
@lornalister94 we were there!

@shriya_saran1109 stupid fanatic person. What’s wrong that someone bring his family to second world largest aquarium?
All i can hear is Ty Burrell’s voice from Finding Dory. 🐳 🐳 🐳
REALLY? This is shameless. This animal should be in the sea, not in captivity for the entertainment of stupid people. UNFOLOWING
I hope the film, is about, you set the beautiful animal free, also in real life🧐
@14_alex_41 Ha, I don’t do fashion, but that’s not the point. Some can do it sustainably. And so your argument is “in the wild, they would be killed”? 🤮🤮 Right, let’s have them all in cages and swimming pools rather than in oceans, that represents 70% of the planet Earth. Let’s just completely finish to destroy these species by having them captive which is against their nature, rather than work to ban those poachers! Jeez, use your brain!
@amyj007 what’s wrong that someone brought his family to visit the world second largest aquarium? Are listening to yourself?
Awe that is the sweetest!
Those muscles 💪🏻
Love it xx
Great 👍😃❤️

@melie_mt the idiot was referring to me doing fashion, makes me laugh!! Can’t debate properly so has to resort to picking holes in my lifestyle/career. Anyway, you’re so so right. I genuinely don’t believe what these people are on! Clearly aren’t aware how many are actually in the wild still!😂
Nice
@arek_calisthenics They shouldn't be in the tanks. They're amazing and intelligent mammals! And he should know this - not taking pictures of them in the aquarium...
Cool
Well I won't be ever seeing another movie of yours again! YOU LACK INTELLIGENCE if you think it's OK to play with animals enslaved to a concrete tank. And here was us thinking you had muscles AND a brain. How wrong we are! It's a sad day when someone with such popularity spreads such a cruel and unkind message to millions...
@rodrigues_ridge22 Look!
@birdslayeggs hahaha you should educate yourself.. I haven't watched black fish or other Netflix doc. I have just spent time reading both sides of the story. And only one makes sense to a normal thinking human... FREE THE WHALES
Omg. I love this man. But i love it more. It's so cute. 😆😆😆

@ethically_elizabeth He isn't supporting animal abuse by just merely visiting an aquarium.
On the left The Rock on the right The Rock in water
@amyj007 How is he supporting aquariums at all?
Animals like this shouldn't be held in captivity to generate money 🙄😞 I like you Dwayne but you have so many fans, you should use your  reach to make people aware of this cruel practice
Soo magestic and beautiful.
@14_alex_41 he is promoting aquariums but putting it on social media. How is that not supporting them. This aquarium talks about conversation however finding anything about this on their website is a stretch. Mammals are not meant for captivity. That’s it!
Thank you for supporting zoos and aquariums! I’m sure that you got to witness the first class care that animals at accredited facilities receive! Great picture!
Its #whalelove
Wow so cute 💜💜💜💜
@tschlenkr oh so your the dolphin whisperer everyone downtown is talking about.
"Staggering intelligence" to locked in a bathtub. Sure he's fucking thrilled.
@katarzyn_01
A true example of a great person, check out my profile if you’re looking for more :)
@therock  And the aquarium parking lots are bigger than the living quarters for these animals.. how messed up is that. This is nothing but animal #prison
What is the man the Rock is cooking ???
@cajun_pinoy Belugas are not fish!!! Cetaceans (whales and dolphins) are highly intelligent  and highly social creatures with complex social structures. They also live in and travel across vast expanses of oceans. No matter how much we might love interacting with them, we cannot replicate their environment in captivity. They suffer in captivity.
Superb
This beautiful creature needs to be free!! Captivity is so sad!
Awesome!!!
Its beautiful but its sad that they in a fish bowl and not ocean.  #getthemoutintothewild
@malachim1102 what do u mean? I was on your side. I'm hoping to 1 day be locked in a jail without committing a crime. If that dolphin doesn't like it, Idk what his problem is.
Love u rock
Go see them in the wild @therock and swim with them... do not support aquariums like these and promote them to the millions of followers you have who need education on the subject 🤷🏼‍♂️ love animals, in their environment...not false habits we create where they do not belong.
Love your next co- star😁
هلو
@christina.posttt Let me try again. Your “fact” that “proves” the docu is “BS”, is the fact that the trainers were fired for violating safety regulations. So, if it’s true, how long do you think they were doing it? So how long was it dangerous for the animals and the people? And maybe it wasn’t even true, and they got fired because they helped denounced the parc they were employed with? 🤦🏻‍♀️ So, what I was saying is: you’re really not helping your case here, on the contrary. You are the one spreading misinformation..
@mad_bananasss You make absolutely no sense at all. This is about the cruelty in keeping cetaceans in captivity where we cannot replicate the conditions they would live in if they were wild (the ocean). Has absolutely no bearing on pets or people!!!
You’re better than that. Animals are not human toys!
@melie_mt mk 🤭
💪👊💥
@tschlenkr did I sound mad? It’s an honor to meet one who can hear the whispers of the nails as well as you. You sound defensive. Why?
oh my dolphinnn
So disappointed to see you supporting the captivity of a sentient being.
Animals, though you probably think nails are protected under the Geneva convention.
Can’t believe you are promoting animal cruelty like this . These animals live in the artic not concrete swimming pools.
I wish you could use your voice to bring attention to the toxic dumping into the Gulf Of Mexico by the big sugar companies in South Florida. Dolphins, sea turtles, manatees and all other sea creatures are losing their lives by the thousands. Help! #siestakey #redtide

@filippocarigi
Bet most of these people have a fish tank in their house lol
#emptythetanks bad, I agree beautiful creatures. But they shouldn't be in tanks for our entertainment. It's stupid and not fair to the dolphins, whales and sharks. They swim miles and miles on a day, and we put them in enclosures of 30m3. It's unfair #backfish #thecove
@malachim1102 didnt say u sounded mad. Well thank you but I must admit I don't hear nails whispering. I've never heard of that. How was that defensive? Sarcastic yea. Defensive nope. Defensive would mean I found anything you wrote intelligent.

#CaptivityKills #emptythetanks #theirenslavementisnotentertainment #BanAquariums educate yourself on captivity.
All aquariums should be closed down. Keeping these animals in capitvity is cruel. By posting pictures of yourself with these animals is promoting animal cruelty. Stop and think about  what your doing.
@moanalima awwwww, you finally got to meet @therock 💀💀💀
I've no idea who he is, the whale should not be there, I was alerted to this post by AR groups. Wild animals deserve better than the humans give them. Please consider joining an #emptythetanks group.

Oh my gah.  Two of my favorites in one pic. 😍
This is so incredibly disappointing.  #rolemodelnomore Stop abusing innocent animals that should never be in captivity in the first place.  You should be ashamed.  You claim to be an animal lover.  You sit on gators, you eat animals, and now you promote zoos and live animals being used as props in movies.  You have a choice they don’t.  You make lots of money and get to go home and take vacations, they’re stuck in prison.  C’mon @therock Be a hero for animals.  People are very against animal use and abuse now and the movement is growing each and every day with truth & Justice on our side.  Be on the right side of history.  Stop abusing animals and #govegan ... be an example for others and help save the animals and save the earth so kids like me can have a future.

@malachim1102 you tell her! What animal doesn't love to be locked in a cage or a pool? From miles and miles of ocean to the equivalent of a bathtub doing tricks for selfish people. If that dolphin doesn't love that, he's just spoiled.

Aquarium?? @therock come on dude 🤦🏻‍♂️#emptythetanks
All these triggered vegans doe
That’s my favorite animal your very lucky to be that close to him! @therock
I love animals! Especially rhinos, Dogs, polar bears, and penguin
@shriya_saran1109 chill out lady....there are some left in aquarium and some are meant in the wild....surely @therock dont have any intention promoting animal in captivity....he just having a good time...animal activist....such a pain in the ass....all of you should eat grass and think again b4 start posting....what u wear what u use....
Then they probably shouldn’t be in aquariums if they’re such beautiful and pure creatures, yeah? Unless he is in rehabilitation.

Those always come up to the front of the tank n either blow bubble rings or kisses at me. ( animals love me) but I was still surprised they tried to communicate thru the glass. I was as enchanted as they were with me! We blew bubbles , rings n kisses as long as I was allowed to hang out. I love them n miss them!

@haulinboats Hello. Right, to start with, I have never put in question the way they were treating the animals, apart from the fact that they have them captive in tanks, have I now? And second, when I see the little respect with which you talk to people on there, I don’t want to engage in more details with ya! But thanks!
Absolutely beautiful animal..Heynthey would treat you better than most humans...You couldn't ask for a better co-star Ibagree!👍💙😌🐬
@christina.posttt So you basically demonstrate by your own fact that most of these parcs are rubbish places where animals are at best not appropriately treated. Well done you!👏

@jayne_centurion let him enjoy the park chill
Follow me
Everyone on here coming after him for posting this... He eats meat still. And I'm sure some of you do, as well. The fact that you aren't bothered by that, but will post condemning this less violent act, (which I'm not cool with, I'm a vegan, I don't support this) shows the disconnect that so many people has. Only against this kind of treatment when it's pushed in front of your face, and people are telling you to care.

Why are y’all hating on him he  is saying that the animal is majestic he’s not standing for animals to be in captivity y’all are stupid @therock you did everything right I respect you your an amazing person
Thank you for being a voice for the animal world and showing your support and sharing the knowledge you gain with your kids because they are the future and will continue to be animal warriors!

Really disappointed in you. I’ve loved every movie you’ve been in, but sure won’t watch this one if you use this beautiful animal that lives in a tank. This beautiful creature belongs in the ocean!! And I won’t watch any of your next movies either. So, so disappointed!
Fucking unbelievable how many losers god damn @therock  you have to pay the prices for being a normal human being 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
Oh Wow!!!
@shriya_saran1109 shhhhhhhhhh you don't know what you're talking about.
@therock  ANIMAL RIGHTS TERRORISTS are spreading their SHAMEFUL IDEOLOGY and try to FORCE everyone ... but they have NO KNOWLEDGE of these animals!! TRUST TRAINERS AND BIOLOGISTS such as the GEORGIA AQUARIUM who are real saviours of nature!! ❤❤❤ THANK YOU DWAYNE for supporting them ❤❤❤🤙🏼 Don't believe those haters!! They are known for hate, racism, criminal activities harming animals and people...

This brilliant animal should be in the wild to live it's life as nature intended!!!"
You are full of shit too. You support the fashion industry. Well let's see from were is coming many of the shit that you use!
That’s so stunning 😁👍🏼

@beezyfpickles animals that go through slaughter is not natural. Animals getting raped continuously to stay pregnant to offer you your pleasure food is not natural. And what, you’re going to say you’re a feminism? When you can live out in the wild and survive and sink those “fang” teeth of yours into flesh, do let me know. Sure it will go on, for now. But things are changing my friend. Eventually the tipping point will come. Either that or people like you will continue to shy away from what’s happening in the world and the world will end. Way things are aren’t sustainable. Maybe you should do a bit of research. Keep up the ignorance ✌🏻
@pilinnemnom @marinanemnom el acuario de Giorgia se acuerdan ? El pasaba por encima de nosotros en las vitrinas 🤣🤣
Neat! I wanna see one live one day
Ahhh -Mazing
@albae96
@beezyfpickles only way women can nurse is if they had a baby, didn’t you know? And in your comment babies are being nursed, not 5 yr olds or adults. Why do you need milk at your age? Do you even know what milk does for you? Look into it
@streetartglobe best comment I’ve seen all my life.
@therock shame on you, supporting animal abuse! #emptythetanks
@tank.sinatra dayum why you gotta roast yourself like that bro... except tbh the whale isn’t rlly ugly it’s kinda cute... AGh
Lffflll
@derbyshiremum oh no unfollowing my gosh jeez the whale is fed, safe, happy, has friends and hoomans, and so on. Sure it’s meant to be out in the open, but why can’t it be living that rich life?
Aw that’s so cute!!!
They are amazing! Got to interact with Klondike at Sea World, what an unforgettable experience.

Hey @therock. Is the beluga whale really happy and cheerful as you are or she really pretend to be to do so.Can you just free her (just the one with you are posing) in oceans where she would'nt have to pretend doing all the things with smiley face.You can definetely do it with all your money and all your stardome,as obviously there will hardly anyone who will stop an initiative of you with a good cause,i believe. #use_your_power #for_a_happy_world #count_begins_from_one

Cute😍😍😍😍
I can see the headlines... Rock attacked by albino dancing fish
So much hate.... no wonder why most of 9you dont care about the captivity or caring for animals.... look how you treat your own kind these comments show a window each person's compassion levels. Shame on you

Black Fish IS NOT factual. Come on people, educate yourselves. Don’t believe something just because it claims to be a documentary.  Accredited zoos and aquariums are research, education and conservation organizations first and foremost. They are not-for-profit and spend millions of dollars annually to help preserve these species. If we close them down thousand of species will be lost forever. Support their efforts. Don’t condemn them.
@marco.gag are you like 40? Lol
Why would you delete all the comments talking about animals in captivity. At the end of the day it’s all a PR stunt for you and for animals it’s torture life sentence, suffering ..now I will never watch your movie again💔
Wait a damn minute!!!! You're in Atlanta and didn't come see me?!!!!!!!
Very nice pic

@cheydenyo
This is crazy it looks fake lol ur the man @therock always working hard, meeting fans.....fist bumpin belugas 😂
Why that dolphin looks albino..
You’re all a bunch of hypocrites.  The guy took his family to the aquarium Jesus.  You’re preaching to him as you wear clothes, shoes, jewelry that all came from slave labor over seas so get off your high horse.  Just because you’re passionate about animals doesn’t mean everyone else has to have the same view.  The best is the vegans on here.  Do you know how many animals are slaughtered everyday to produce the food you eat?  Farming kills and displaces more animals then the meat industry.  Hypocrites
I wish I was the dolphin 😘
Bad form! exploitation! This animal belongs in the wild. NOT at your beckon call!
@therock Here the whale is showing off his amazing core and The Rock is giving the fist bump of approval... :D lol
Linda!! Olha essa carinha de bebê.
“ aside from the long-standing US court battle involving the Georgia Aquarium’s attempts to obtain wild-caught belugas from Russia, the capture and captivity of beluga whales has not before been the subject of such public scrutiny.” http://us.whales.org/blog/2017/12/whitefish-cruelty-behind-russian-beluga-whale-trade
Beautiful
Oh yeah look at that beautiful animal in captivity. 💔 set it free if you want to be a real hero.
Cool
@rachellpeterss I’m curious to hear how you know the animals “love it there” and are “friends with their trainers”.... and how you could possibly say they’re not in captivity. Those are some pretty specific claims ... you must speak beluga? Animals are separate beings that live by their own codes and have their own social hierarchy; just because an animal is trained to do tricks on command and perform daily for humans does not mean they are “friends” or “love” being trapped in a tiny aquarium instead of being free to roam the ocean.

@bradleyabi I hope you realize Balckfish is full of lies. Not only that, but the trainers featured in the “documentary” were all fired for violating safety regulations. Also may I mention that one of the trainers only worked with the Sea Lions and never worked with the Killer Whales. Get the facts don’t get #blackfished :)
Awesome

@alviramurisonswartz I agree. Aquariums and their scientists do everything they can to give them a good life. Most are rescues who would normally die in the wild because of an impairment or injury. All good aquariums are nonprofit and are all about education and conservation not making money off entertainment like sea world used to do.
Hermosos
Hahahaha i love ur jokes, lov u.... greetings from Peru😘

Hellllll ya
Yes, these are VERY intelligent and majestic creatures. They should be free to roam the oceans and not be trapped in aquariums for their entire lives. Please use your power and voice to advocate for the fair treatment of animals and educate the public; I am a fan of yours but it’s hard to stomach seeing pictures of animals in aquariums.  A picture’s worth 1000 words and the message you’re sending to the uninformed is that these animals are happy and that’s its completely justifiable that they’re being used for the purpose of entertaining the public and generating revenue. Regardless of there potentially being some educational aspect to seeing a beluga up close it CERTAINLY doesn’t outweigh the bad of this mistreatment and exploitation.
@pablocm15 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Dear @therock I'm fan of you beacuse you are good actor and you re very humble but this it's disappointed that animal it's a beluga and belongs in the wild , so this beluga learn through suffering that tricks for entertainment . It's shame a famous and influence people like you support this. I invite you watch awarded documentaries like @racingextinction @blackfish_movie to change your mind and hopefully enjoys this beautiful animals in the wild ,where belongs. Greetings and hugs from Chile
Everybody with their phony outrage and endless self back patting, it's like a domino effect. What's funny is that everyone truly believes that posting a bitchy comment on an instagram post is "doing something." I'd be very surprised if everyone is still upset about this next week, hell, still upset tomorrow!
Wow!
The Rock found a better actor than himself.
Lucu juga tuh
nice

He white like that ..from incest .. probably..just like the white tigers be from incest
@fob2gu 😂
@ethically_elizabeth shut up
Wow.. everyone I want to thank you for saying how wrong it is for animals to be in captivity so I decided to leave the gate open and let my three dogs run free. Let’s just say one of them made it across the street
So sad that someone just wants to go and admire these animals in person and people get offended. Anything we do now just gets judged by people who are “offended”. These people are the ones ruining the world we live in

Everyone talking about supporting animals in captivity you do know that if they are not captured at some point in life they will get devoured by a mammal bigger than them, then we would never know of their beautiful existence... They are well fed, taken care of and are able to display their talents/intelligence to the world... What is wrong with that?
Superb 😉

Thank you for appreciating animals and supporting the conservation efforts put forth by today’s MODERN zoos and aquariums. We live in a world where these facilities are the last hope for the survival of countless species. These organizations are not-for-profit and rely on people like you who are willing to educate themselves and become part of the solution. For all of you haters who aren’t vegan, please start looking at your own hypocrisy and leave this guy alone.
Yes, it looks fun!!🙌🙌

@brycelong944 hahaha I just snagged on a mammal @jtrott_
Alright high five 🖐
For those who feel it’s cruel to put any animal in captivity, your showing up to the party late. Climate change has put these animals on an extinction list, we who were once their greatest threat have now become their only chance of survival, for example as the glaciers melt polar bears will drown out to extinction if left alone, like it or not these profit driven abusive corporations who cage them now will one day be the first step in the evolution of the saving these majestic species by MAN not nature who has decided to put them on the path to extinction
Awwwwwwww tht dolphin should of been in Rampage i loved tht movie
; )
Wow...
I bet if you looked at them from a over view they’d looked kinda similar
I post pics of my cats daily
really disappointed by this. you have such a large voice and platform and your using it to promote the captivity of these animals. it’s not right. please please please learn about the truth behind these places before you promote them.
@bradleyabi so let this thing live out in the wild to be poached by people hunting it for its skin...?

"Mission Statement:

Our mission is to start a non-profit organization to be able to accomodate up to 10 million people. I want to build a huge facility and turn it into a peaceful town by bringing all the homeless in america to one place. 
to help the continueing:
 building
 farming
 reeducating
 job placement

Second step is the same thing except a huge drug rehab to get all the drug users off the streets.
The facilities already in place, must remain open for proper selection. We do not want anyone with alterior motives entering this facility. 
Also we plan to bring in all the animals that are being harmed by anyone and providing them with food and shelter. All the over flowed kennels,, the animals people jjust cant care for anymore. even people about to loose everything may come, work and help. Until we can put them back into society in their passion.

Also we would like to provide safety to all the women and children whom are being abused.
We would need to start a special police force, or small army to keep out anyone looking for these people trying to cause harm or chaos. We allso will need a special IT task force to prevent any damage. 
Think of this as a savior colony in a way, in middle america. 
Power Sources:

Geo Thermal
Solar Panels
Wind Farms
Hemp Fuel
A Goal is to Farm marijuana:
Hemp Fuel
Hemp Clothes
More oxygen
Great income to keep this place running with out future donations; Also donations to scientific research, space exploration, underwater exploration. medical advancements
Food Sources:
Vegetable Farms
This will become a model Colony to the whole world. 
I am attempting to start a non-profit foundation to be able to collect money from many different non profit organizations, so i can build a huge colony basically on 
210 acres of land in colorado.  After its built, basically the whole colony takes care of itself with no more funding needed.

Captivity sucks man, come with me and see them in the wild.
Knowing your track record with movies that is entirely possible. WORST. ACTOR. EVER. (Toothfairy, Hercules, Doom, GI Joe, Witch mountain, central intelligence, skyscraper) God idk how you keep getting movie roles. You are a very likable fellow so nobody really has the stones to tell you.

Not a fan of you anymore. Unfollowing.
It looks like your having a whale of a time
That is  not okay, those animals are supposed to be in the ocean and in an aquarium for human entreteniment

@beezyfpickles yes mame i am vegan. I don’t even watch cnn. Trust me I’m more open minded than most. Yes human produce milk, but only for their babies. Do you produce milk when you don’t have an infant? Nope. If you walked down the street and saw a women breast feeding her 5 yr old child would that be normal? C’mon. Humans are the only dumb as species that still drinks milk after infancy. From a cow non the least! And please tell me why cow’s milk is good for ya?!
Lol
@daiana.gomees
OMG

@linagiselle1
I have to say I am truly disappointed that you have not used your platform for good... In supporting these animals and there right to be free. In an entire world full of oceans instead of a pool and a film industry. For our "entertainment" after watching the "blackfish" documentary a few years ago I have not been to any place that locks up animals. Zoos, Wild life centres or aquariums.
Nice Good Superb pics
@mayordazebenice what does that have to do with protesting holding wild animals in captivity?
Drown out all the haters and keep doing what you are doing. You got to see how awesome these animals are care for. You are creating the next generation of people who actually care about animals!
I love these morons losing their shit over something they have no control over.  Let the Rock and his family enjoy THEIR time.
@ethically_elizabeth Well said. What a disgrace. It’s 2018- we know that captivity kills and that it’s completely unethical to support aquariums and zoos. Im surprised he posted this photo. Also some of the responses to your comment are sooooooo stupid, it’s mind blowing.
That’s one strong beluga! Bet he gave you a firm handshake! 😂
Set dem freee😢😢
Thank you for supporting good zoos and aquariums!
#trailer Looking forward to anything from you, such a blessing your soul!! #hattippin
@sadafr - now that I know he’s open to super white shapeless things... I’m in with a chance!
@ijustine this isn’t cute at all! This is a wild animal, being held in a tank, deprived the freedom to swim and hunt naturally, being exploited for people to be “entertained”. It’s 2018- we don’t need to capture and jail wild animals to be entertained.
Had to track down your account just to show support. As I'm not a regular follower. Many many biologists and sealife personnel got started because of aquariums and seeing these amazing animals up close. They aren't in the wild but do an important job of putting us in touch with what the world will lose if we aren't careful. Thanks for the photos.
@feebee76 Well said 🙏
Stop that shit ! Those are animals and not yours for entertainment!
Bye
@derbyshiremum can you protect them from poachers and millions of tons of plastic in the ocean? Or is that their “natural habitat”
👌👌👌
@elisabethdawn it’s such odd behaviour right?! Maybe he’s being paid by Seaworld?

"funfact little offtopic a lot of city children doesn't even know food like corn comes from the ground or other fruits and vegetables. 
the only way children can learn is some by school, some by books, and most just by the internet which is what people are trying to keep there children from too much computer time which this would increase there tv or computer time to learn like history channel or kids edu channels"

Shut up
@ethically_elizabeth shut up, quick being so sensitive
Dude please don't support animals in captivity. You are a good guy!
😂😂
Should not be in captivity like this. It’s a shame you are supporting the industry
Their place is at sea.
You folks need to ease up on your lecturing.  If it were free roaming, pollution would kill it off sooner rather than later. I hope everyone protesting is a devout vegan and also doesn’t support any business that utilizes animals in any capacity.
So cute 😁😁❤

MAKING A DIFFERENCE “The first thing I’d ask people is to not buy a ticket to the Seaquarium, or to SeaWorld, or to any dolphin display or dolphin swim-with park. They all perpetuate the notion that whales and dolphins can be confined and subjugated for our entertainment, as if they don't suffer from incarceration, domination, immobility and all the injuries and diseases that inevitably accompany captivity. We ask that everyone understand this from the point of view of the whale or dolphin, knowing they are highly conscious and aware of their surroundings and conditions.” – Howard Garrett/Orca Network"

Sometimes it hard to see what our actions portray, but when you have an influence over so many people, you HAVE TO!!!! YOU are promoting the capture, torture, rape, and imprisonment of sentient beings. They do not deserve this, and for what? YOUR selfish reasons. There is not one reason you can give to validate your actions. And by taking about other “good things” you’ve done does NOT erase what you are representing in this photo!!!!!

@redden12301 I’m Latino/mexican my family is the bottom! Whether we have these fish tanks or not our lives wouldn’t be any better or worst. These animals are suffering period. I would rather spend more money to see these animals in the wild unharmed than to see them in horrible conditions that they try to cover up.
You rock
Awwwwww
Rock y did u give up in WWE RAW
@therock what where you thinking!?! How can you promote such cruelty?? Your a roll model!!!!! My Son looked up to you growing up, I know he will agree with me! These animals are RIPPED AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILYS!! Stuck in TINY SWIMMING POOLS!!! STARVED them until they do the tricks you want them to do!! This is a BAD MOVE 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼 #ShameOnYou #TheRock #EmptyAllTheTanks #BadMove #AllLivesMatter #CallingAllActivists
Ugh, so sad to see a big star like @therock advocating captivity. These majestic animals deserve to live freely and not be held captive to entertain humans. We know better now. Time to make amends. #emptythetanks #dontbuyaticket

For Fucks sake. Not you, Dwayne. Not you. 😥 You're better than this.
I find it hilarious that you can't even take your family to an aquarium without people being so butt hurt about it ! Seriously stop. It's an aquarium. It's a thing. Get over it. It's a cool experience for kids and adults to interact with Earth's amazing creatures. It's always going to be there. Get over yourself. You rock @therock

Their place is at sea.
@dtipontheblock are we going to ignore the fact that when I went there for the first time, all excited to see the whale sharks, one of the employees told me that was their 4th that year and they don't expect them to live long at all? Like we don't even know their population count because they are so hard to find in order to count them (reliably) but they're gonna keep shipping them in? Like nah, they are doing more harm than good in this case...

I dont know if you are able to read this, out of all the comments you recieve. But i know i had read about some people throwing out negative comments about your visit to the aquarium and it broke my heart to see the attack on you.. i feel so much respect for you and i know you would never let the haters get you down. But just know you are an inspiration in growth, self sacrifice, and kindness. I feel, you would never accept an animal to be hurt for your own gain.. i am just throwing some positive energy your way, because you are a hero in your own right.. thank you for your time and allowing me and so many others to join your journeys, your beautiful family, and your gains.. #inspiration. #warrior #proudtobeafan...

Great to see it locked up. Freedom isn’t worth your enjoyment aye  @therock
@ngc1976_ Thank you. I am not trying to be right, this isn't even about a personal opinion - these are facts. I've spent SO much time with whales in the wild, and when you do that, you can only KNOW that they belong in the ocean with their families. I am a bit depressed to see just how few people are telling The Rock that this kind of "activity" is nothing but cruelty. We know better nowadays. He said it himself - this beluga is intelligent. They are sentient beings. I spent two summers watching belugas in their natural environment. They stay with their social groups for all.their.lives. They travel so much. And here in this photo, a lonely beluga is forced to pose and perform. People don't wanna see what's happening backstage - the information is OUT now, we didn't know in the past, but today we just can't close our eyes when facts are right in our face.

@therock is that the Atlanta aquarium? The one right next to the Coca-Cola factory? It's seriously jaw dropping and beautiful. I took my soon to be fiance there last year. Luckily my parents live in Georgia haha because we live in maryland

They shouldn't be locked up though :( that part is horribly sad

Super disappointed you support the captivity of these beautiful creatures
Although this is a beautiful photo and a beautiful creature, please don't support aquariums. There are so many things wrong with them.. nothing deserves to be locked up in a tiny (compared to their homes) cage

It is so disappointed to see a performer of your fame agree to do anything with animals in captivity. You should support finding these beautiful, mind loving animals in their home.  Stop the captivity of animals.  It has take., and is still taking, is a long time to get the message out - close circuses, rodeos, zoos, hog wrestling.  Those participating are human by birth  but do not display humanity.
Should be free Rock! Cruel to capture these amazing creatures and lock them in a tiny prison for humans Entertainment ! Use your power to set them free??? Speak up for them.
Animals want freedom, aquariums are prisons! 😔💔

@danielwheinzen Thank you. I didn't realise there were so few. have another comment somewhere here where I further explain my view. If it is necessary to keep them in captivity then we should do so in a way where they can express their natural behaviors and not teach them to perform trucks and other nonsense. It's like saying "We'll save your species, but then you have to work for us".
Pretty much ur animal soul spirit.

Educate yourself about captivity please do you know where that beluga came from watch #Blackfish you took a picture years ago with Lolita /Tokitae at Miami Seaquarium  follow @dolphin_project so many people like you maybe you can use for voice to speak out for these sweet souls who belong in the ocean not at an aquarium for a picture .
Don’t you think these animals deserve to be free? They don’t belong in captivity.
@classicj_0691 your comments do nothing for me as well because they’re false. I know firsthand.

Que linda experiencia
@therock if you truly believed they are amazing creatures, which they are, you would not support their captivity!!! Many animals such as the beluga whale are stolen away  from their families in the wild forced to live glorified bathtubs  for the rest of their lives. Others are born in captivity and will never experience the freedom of living in the wild, which is hardly any better. Please be on the right side of history and do NOT support aquariums or zoos!!!
Eu na vida sou o golfinho
I’m really surprised to see this from you. It breaks my heart because I view you as one of the good guys. These animals are slaves.

@sindifigueroa Que linda experiência o que? Animais capturados na natureza ou já nascidos em cativeiro, fadados a viver para sempre em tanques de concreto para entreter as pessoas. O que tem de lindo nisso, afinal? Sobre "cultura" que explora o sofrimento de outros seres. Sobre "diversão" que desconsidera interesses não-humanos. Sobre "entretenimento" que se pauta no encarceramento de animais indefesos. Precisamos repensar nossa existência.
So cute

@wandering_wave my man is in Georgia and he didn’t even bother to text me
Awesome!!! Happy you enjoyed the Georgia Aquarium!!!
Most animals aren't captured anymore, they are either born in captivity or rescued if they are injured. It's that or they are an endangered species. Would you rather have an animal go extinct or captured/rescued by zoos/aquariums. Or have a  dolphin die from being tangled in a net and not being able to reach the surface so it suffocates or is eaten by a predator.  Yes, they should treat the animals better, but it's also safer for endangered species to prevent extinction.
@valkryxii lmao so bothered....this uneducated low self esteem private profile got you soooo bothered ....nah baby it's you I feel sorry for .....good night 💋💋💋💋

Awwww
@valkryxii iktsr and tell ya boo stay out my inbox 👌👌 💗💗💋💋💋
Wow, I am so disappointed in you @therock I was thinking so highly of you just to be met with this ignorance. Please educate yourself before you promote captivity and abuse, for the sake of the new generations and your children's
Love this picture! I was mesmerized by the personalities of the Beliga whales at the Mystic Aquarium in Massachusetts! Stood there for a solid hour just adoring them!
Simply amazing! Accredited zoos and aquariums have come a very long way and are now doing incredible work for wildlife. You have brought a lot of smiles to people who have dedicated their careers to animals and wildlife conservation. Thank you for sharing your experience! 💕💕💕
#endcaptivity this is bullshit
@angelacipolla underrated he has 112 million followers....? Yeet?
@stefanie2266 marine land says the same thing, doesn’t mean a damn thing.
Set him free! Please don’t support the confinement of wild animals. 😢
Pure joy on your face ❤️
@xrockrulesx 😭😭😭
pls do not promote, slavery of the natural world
But those animals do not belong in a cage!
@missmorganwalker any advice on what I should season my streak with?
Doesn’t look like Kevin Rock. Probably sounds like him though. Lol
Coisa linda💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
You monster you punched them

@only_niyah_ 😭😭😭"relocatinggg"
Awesome
You look very similar. Bald and beautiful!
This is extremely disappointing. Given your popularity, you should know better when you post something like this on social media. You should lead by example and not encourage your thousands of followers to go to a captive facility. I also cannot believe how many people are actually praising you for doing that and agreeing. Cetaceans are intelligent and social creatures that belong in the wild with their families. They should not spend their lives in concrete pools, performing stupid tricks for frozen fish. Come on. We're in 2018. We know better. Don't support cruelty.
Ace Ventura remake?
The rock is the next pet detective ace Venturas brother
This poor baby in captivity. I’m sorry little Beluga 😔
That is so cute.
Wow!  Beautiful creatures both !!! 😋😊😉
@therock get them all out of there!!!

That dolphin is so beautiful.
Muero..demasiado bello
Animale stupendo e uomo coglione
Beautiful ❤️
@katiemadams i don’t rly get the infatuation
@therock if you think that these animals are beautiful  with staggering intelligence,  Why are you supporting this CRUELTY and captivity to your followers?  Do you think these creatures want to live in a fcking pool and do stupid tricks for stupid selfish people???? So disappointed in @therock
@mramirez_1 is that you?!😳
@shriya_saran1109 thank you

Go
Cute

@classicj_0691 Wow, I really do feel sorry for you. Your self confidence seems really low, probably due to your intelligence level. That's why you talk shit on a private profile, so you can seem smart to the public, but you don't want the world seeing how you really are. You'll get good one day girl👏 But acting like this won't help.
beautiful indeed 🐳
@theneonrunner boo boo is right. No loss with you

Amazing 😍 im jealous
@erockafashion ugh I looooooove this😍😍😍😍 so much!
King rock
Hermoso animal.. pero no apruebo los acuarios😡
My dream
Literally so jealous! 😍😘❤️💕
@raquelnovaes gente,eu tenho um aquario 😂
I went last year and got in the tank with them
No No No! @therock this hurts so bad that you would support these horrible aquariums! They are not meant to be in a tank! They live in pods with their families and are captured and put in captivity. This is disgusting! You should be boycotting these places not giving these places publicity! Shame!
Look how happy he is!  Lets all give a big shout out and thank you to @georgiaaquarium for making this possible.  Without them, that beluga would never have been able to meet @therock !  Aquariums are amazing, fun, and EDUCATIONAL.
"Please remember that the Georgia aquarium contributes to the decimation and capture of these wild animals. In 2015 they were denied a request to import 18 Russian belugas that were caught specifically to fill their quota and held in terrible conditions, virtually chewing holes in each other’s backsides, all because of the Georgia aquarium. Thankfully they were DENIED. Via global news “The Georgia Aquarium has decided not to appeal a federal judge’s ruling that effectively prevents it from importing 18 beluga whales from Russia.

U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg ruled in September that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Marine Fisheries Service properly applied the Marine Mammal Protection Act in denying the aquarium’s permit to import the belugas.” Via the Orlando sentinel “SeaWorld says it no longer wants any of the captured beluga whales at the center of a legal controversy.

The Georgia Aquarium is trying to overturn a federal decision denying its request to import the 18 Russian whales captured several years ago. SeaWorld would have received some of them under a breeding loan.”"
I love Beluga whales! And the Rock!
I just found out I’m having a baby. Im so freaked out and I’m telling the world!
❤
Those animals should be free.. Lol.. HERDENZUGTIERE
hahahahahhas
Gorgeous Beluga!!
@therock what about the animal rights? Apparently you are not intelligent enough to realize this awesome creatures are confined in tanks, private of their freedom and natural habitat #disappointed #badpublicity #stopanimalabuse
Haha I liked this because of how amazing the photo is at first. Then I read the caption and laughed so I liked it again. So here is one like for the photo and another like for the quote. (Too bad you can like something more than once) Hahaha

Awe! Welcome to the atl @therock! Come up to the burbs and make a movie in the growing Cumming,GA. Would love to see you around town (and so would my boys!!) 🤣
So disappointing Dwayne!!!! #stolenbeauty #untileverycageisempty #dontbuyaticket 😡😡😡😡😡
@zackyalisu mas o que importa é que o cara pode tirar foto com o animal que ele quiser, a beluga não é doida de dizer não pro the rock
@marge0923 I saw
Awesome!!!
yes Awesome
@kcthunders Boop The Rock. 😂
@steppponmeee  oOooOooOooOooOooooOoO

People getting up in arms need to pipe down and realize that many of the animals there are brought there through rescue and rehabilitation efforts and not just sucked from the sea for show.
Finally a good person that cares about NATURE 🐋🐳
@ruthkhan38 its him!

So sad. Money buy dignity.

I tell ya, people are not Happy if they are not seeking out. .someone to put down.  Dwayne was having a fun family day. If this upsets you then I guess billions who go visits zoos aquariums bother you to.
Oh no.... please don’t support marine life in captivity!! Please watch the dvd Blackfish xx
Please don't support animal cruelty.
@daniellemarie1221 I don't support zoos or aquariums....you can drink the kool aid if you want to but unless they're in the wild, its abuse.....so your comment did nothing for me but thanks
So lucky! Belugas are my favourite!
Have a great day Dwayne not all your fans feel bad  about you going to the aquarium.
@seashellsandbumblebees
What is she thinking?
@therock this photo is of two of my favorite things 😁🐋🦈
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
@karlsch86 😂😂😂😂😂
@daniellemarie1221 unless they cant release them back into the wild because they were raised by humans from jumo....they should be in the wild....and learning that you will only be fed is if you do some trick for a trick....that's abuse

No ellos deben estar en su hábitat natural para que ellos estén allí deben ser separados de su familia a veces asesinan a sus padres porque nunca lis dejan un albino cuesta muchos dólares no apoyes esto cambia el mensaje @therock  se parte de lo bueno 👍🏻
te amo the rock
@classicj_0691 🤣🤣 OK. I'm sorry you're such an uneducated bleeding heart. 💔 Hope you grow up someone soon girl😘
This is terribly sad. Please don’t promote these actions with your influential platform. 225 belugas were just approved for capture from the wild for a life like this. They’re taken from their families and their ecosystem to entertain you.
😘😘❤❤
Beautiful
@ijustine yeah captive animals that aren’t where they are supposed to be are SO CUTE !! Awww
I loved❤️❤️
@_kkimmiee_ that's the only possible explanation 🤣

COME ON!!! Why are you supporting this shit. Disappointed
You are a beautiful human being, but please...remember that these animals do not deserve to be locked in an aquarium, and that they suffer away from their own kind and waters...not to mention the trainings that often scar their souls. #SeaWorld
@classicj_0691 sanctuaries are essentially the same thing as zoos and aquariums. It’s animals in captivity no matter how you look at it. A lot of zoos and aquariums actually do a lot to raise money for conservation so animals in the wild can keep their homes. Please educate yourself.
HELP ME OUT WITH A GREYHOUND TICKET OUT OF MEMPHIS TN TO TAMPA HARMING PEOPLE AND SUICIDE THOUGHTS A RUNNING IN MY MIND
All these haters! Better not tell them about the giraffe we ate last year!
That's an amazing aquarium. I want to take my daughter there next time we visit.
@therock please watch #thecove and #blackfish educate yourself on captivity! I'm disappointed and brokenhearted that one these beautiful animals are in captivity but most of all you of all people promoting it 💔 #emptythetanks #endcaptivity
What’s the name of the movie
@eldergymrat yep. I do. I also know that  in most cases, aquatic animals in captivity were taken from the wild, or are born into captivity from animals that were taken from the wild. I also know that these sentient animals, with brains that function far higher than a humans, are not used to make shoes, and most leather is used from a by-product of slaughtering. So. Tell me how your argument works here
@bjornhowl why are you so heavily promoting the captivity of these majestic creatures? Who are you trying to protect? After every compassionate person voiced their concern for the animals, you’ve inserted an ignorant comment. If you don’t care about how these animals are captured, treated and their suffering, why not say nothing??
@ethically_elizabeth reputable sources such as..? Can you provide any? Documentaries don’t count. And saying “I’m a marine biologist” doesn’t count either.
"@shriya_saran1109 “Now no shrub had yet appeared on the earth and no plant had yet sprung up, for the Lord God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no one to work the ground,

The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.

Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals. ‭‭Genesis‬ ‭2:5, 15, 19-20‬ ‭NIV‬‬

@jagentek why exactly?
Beautiful
You guys that are upset,get a life,for real.
This is awesome!
They do not live long in captivity at all. They are caught as babies, the other ones are let go as they are not young enough. Watched a documentary on Netflix about these beautiful animals.
So lovely! 😍
Aye nigga we know you strong why u out here PUNCHING DOLPHINS AND SHIT!! @therock

Have you actually saved a species of any kind.Better they are looked after,than to wash up on shoar.Then what? What will you post to save them?
@valkryxii that's a big negative ghost rider, unless it is a sanctuary where they live most like they would in the wild its abuse.... Where they are taught to do tricks to entertain uneducated Neanderthals such as yourself, it is completely and undeniably animal abuse....sooooo go educate yourself goodbye

❤ cute😍
Then why don't you help freeing them
Beluga gains all day 💪🏾
Man......if half of y’all fought this hard for the HUMANS in prison, we might actually get somewhere in this American Society. If people were more HUMANE to humans, maybe that could translate to the Animal Kingdom. Instead y’all wanna come for the Rock when all he wants to do is share a great day he spent with his Family.
@therock I admire you but I do not support this 💔please watch #blackfish and you will regret supporting this place
That is Awesome❤️❤️❤️❤️

@stefilein77 not all aquariums treat animals inhumanely.  Some aquariums offer better lives than them struggling to survive out there and are well fed well cared for happy animals with plenty of daily stimulus.  The loss of extra room to swim is made up for in alll other ways in good aquariums.
OMG! Totally in love. 😍😍😍😍😍😍

Omg u found your twin flame!!!
Yess
Such a bummer to see this. But he probably doesn’t realize the cruelty and the heartbreaking truth behind cetacean captivity and the process of getting these poor animals to perform for ticket-payers.  Before I knew the truth, I thought it was so special to pet a dolphin and to touch a beluga; I loved it, and I thought I loved those animals. I wish I had known the truth then and had never contributed to the false attraction of the captive industry. But when you know better, you do better. I hope @therock will do his research and choose not to support this life-stealing industry. 💜🙏🏼

I’m not sure how I feel about it, man. I mean some zoos and sanctuaries are doing amazing work helping the animals but this? This is not their natural behaviour, they don’t “high five” when free, people made them doing it and it’s not right at all. Kinda disappointed that you promote it... 😢

Wow what an experience that must of been x
se me cayó el mito!!NO A LOS ACUARIOS!!!
Therock instead of promoting animal confinement and abuse, perhaps you should take the time and your celebrity status to educate people on “ doing the right thing” allowing animals to live in their natural habitats where they belong instead in cages and fish bowls for our selfish need to be entertained

Mr Johnson, Its great you felt a connection, but.....You just have a huge shout out to an aquarium that will now benefit from your post. It's a tragedy these animals are kept in a prison. Watch the documentary @blackfish_movie on #netflix with @leilanimunter it really is eye opening. I hope you can use your voice in a positive way to help these and many other whales and dolphins.
Hola como estas es cierto q regalas  dinero  yo siempre  te sigo y mi niño le encantan tus películas mas la del simio como no abla  pero bien q se aprendió las señas  q ASE mi niño es especial te mandamos un abrazo
He should be living wild in the ocean where he belongs 😢
So cute
Wow  hermosa jamás lo había visto
@respectanimalrights
BELUGA WHALES ROCK... Geddit? 😂
That is so true these special animals are so SPECIAL I wanna see some dolphin some day 🐋🐋 that thing I love about these animals is they are extremely intelligent😜(what is your next movie with this beautiful animal?)
I am so disappointed in you! I am a big fan @therock but you shouldn't support this kind of torture. So sad!
Next co-star????! Whuh?!
Jaja awesome
@jagentek says the mormon giving his opinion
@shriya_saran1109 thank you ❤
@king.jeffolo no the things he says are the likes
Not cool 😠
Beautiful
@ethically_elizabeth screw off
Those of you being so critical of his aquarium adventure should realise that the majority of these animals are either ones who were sick, and couldnt be released back into the wild, or were born in captivity by ones who couldnt be released back. Grow the fuck up, theyre being well cared for
Supa
👏
"@disco_stu_33 Says the one who does...?! Nada. Yeah thought so! 
Ah yeah no, the one who commented because he thought smart animals should be able to escape parcs they are being held into🤯Bye mate🙌"
Stop supporting aquariums
@shriya_saran1109 clearly you cannot smell what the rock is cookin
Beluga whales are so cute!
@someplace_random_academy omg no! I wish we could have!!
😂😂😂
Is he a good boy?
Sweet! What's your next movie?
They don’t belong there 👎🏻
It's enough now
@colin9c3 ugh dang it
@shortsandi Rock was my hero growing up but when I see this stuff it makes me more aware that when you live in the celebrity bubble, nothing really matters to these people except their own fame and money. I don’t expect Rock to turn down a movie because of animal exploitation and get labeled difficult to work with ( because apparently when you have morals in Hollywood that a negative) basically Rock is going to do what Rocks gotta do for himself but I salute the actors/ actresses, singers, artists who do speak up on behalf of the animals. Most people are speciesists and don’t even realize it. Epic fail Rock, there’s nothing cool about this photo or using animals for entertainment 👎🏽
👐🍀🍀🍀👐
Noooooooooo😍😍😍👏❤
This is so cool!!
Lol dope pic
@syoast why? And please don't use blackfish as an excuse
@markryan_livingthedream you're annoying
@kaleigh_alexis
Come on @therock  You know better than to support captive animal parks. So disappointing. 💔these poor creatures are ripped away from their families. Let them be free. Didn't you grow up near he ocean?  Sad
@amyj007 no the disappointing part is when I realize how many people support this BS that you're spewing out
@markryan_livingthedream no
@alexispanam22 what do you mean "poor". They're fine
@therock you should read the WSPA’s case against marine mammals in captivity. Any cetacean and or marine mammal in captivity is basically prison. Educate yourself and others on the atrocities of marine mammals in captivity.
OMG, soooooooooooo cuuuuuuuuuuuute!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I’m jealous😋😋😋🤣🤣🤣🤣
@feebee76 no you're wrong. They're perfectly fine and if anything they're safer
@riptide42 no it's not. That's like saying buying horses is slavery. It's not. Get over it
Nicer in the wild x
@mitch_stringaa get over it
😞 disappointed
@currayybitch_
@cambernalnoguera no

I am your biggest fan! I want to see movies just with you in it! You are amazing! Amazing 😉
Thank you for supporting Zoos and Aquariums! Your support means the continuation of conservation of thousands of species across the world 💓💓
Lovely whale
@rachellpeterss thank for not speaking up for animals in captivity. Please do not bother replying because one I will not see it from blocking you and two I will not reply. Have a pleasant evening.

I am so pleased to see how many dissapointing comments this post is getting. The world may be changing after all..but still we get the powerful people to support the captivity of animals like this beautiful and rare mammal. STOP AQUARIUM SUPPORT!! #stopcaptivity #stopaquariums #crueltyfree
@afigg_gq could you use ode here or Na lol
@therock Sir, firstly I am  fan, but this photo makes me sad. I believe that intelligent animals ( people included) should have a say in what they do with their lives. This animal probably didnt have a choice and although I support seeing them in the wild in their homes on their terms, seeing something so beautiful in a tank away from its pod is heart breaking. They form bonds and have many emotions just like people. I would hate for something bigger to come along and put you in a box or cage where you cant see your family, you cant say no, and you basically arent your own person. You have no rights. So please continue being one of my fav actors by striving to protect this beautiful intelligent animal and keeping many of them home and safe where they belong  rather then supporting those who exploit them. I would really hate to see a movie with you in it and a beautiful beluga as your co-star. They just dont belong in the entertainment industry. No animal that cant say no should be exploited on screen or off. Thank you for your attention.
@zahlisbiglap my 2 favourite things the rock & a beluga! 😍

Big muscles, zero compassion
Aw. How. Sweet. Sir. Rock. Fist. Bumps

@therock love all you do but please don’t bless these horrible places with your presence. Watch blackfish . ❤️
This is an awesome picture. I’ll be there next weekend. It’s great how they can take care of these animals so that others who can’t travel all over can see them and appreciate how beautiful they are.

@reinahroo19 Right, we always have those ones, complaining of typo or grammar ay. English is not my first language, so I’m doing better than you all things considered my friend. And ok, if you say so then..ok?! You’re useless sorry to say. Just saying “I know better” doesn’t help, neither the debate or yourself. But ok then. Until next time🤦🏻‍♀️
Can you like my latest photo pls
❤❤❤❤👏👏👏
He’s like, you look like you could be related to me, but prolly not
Fake
Please Rock. Aquariums are cruel places for captive and intelligent creatures. Help set them free. Don’t contribute to their pain and captivity. Speak out!
😍😍😍
This is so wrong. In their natural environment these intelligent animals live in pods with strong family bonds. They shouldn’t be stolen from their families to entertain people. Educate yourself. #blackfish #emptythetanks #thecove
You have such a platform to do good. Please use it to promote the freedom these creatures with staggering intelligence deserve
So so so cute
Wow that s awesome! XD

Beautiful and Intelligent but sadly enslaved to human being so they can be exploited for profit. This picture is taking place based on the conditioning of this abused animals based on hunger and food deprivation. A role model to so many but yet so uneducated to think that this is acceptable to post out. This is the promotion and glorifying of slavery. This is unnatural and must be stopped @therock
You know they're on slew of medication right? Including multiple antidepressants to keep them from just floating around and not eating because they're so depressed... so yes they are intelligent

Get him out of there
@renplusren oh wow ok. I cannot answer that. You’re trying to push it because you know you’re wrong. That’s fine. Glad we set it straight though. It’s wrong. Let’s try to fix it then rather than hoping having orcas as pets🤦🏻‍♀️
I would much prefer, and this animal does too, to be in the wild. I don't need to be up close to him. He is suffering and if you don't see that you are an a**
@iseedrunkpeople you are literally so stupid. First of all, they aren’t taken from the wild. They are either born there or rescued and deemed non releasable by THE GOVERNMENT. Second of all, they live way longer in captivity most of the time because they are constantly being monitored by vets, along with many other reasons. Also, I am very educated on this topic so I’m just going to ignore the other idiotic BS in your comment
Nice! They are big up close! Pod whales are also!
Shame it’s in a swimming pool 😢
@shriya_saran1109 thanks! Just want to say it
#emptythetanks #captivitykills #dontbestupid
Why are you hitting that whale? XD
@reinahroo19 actually they're stolen from their mothers when they are born in the wild.
@shriya_saran1109 yes! 100% agree thanks for standing up!
@chinkins Yeah right. You know what I meant. If not, all this conversation is a non sense and is completely useless. For all the lives they saved, how many have they taken? Or deteriorate? Just for the money? Blimey
@shriya_saran1109 💙💚😢
Please stop promoting this @therock. This ain’t right! 😫
Are you still in character @rampagethemovie
Y'all got the same head @therock 😂
@melie_mt Ohmydooodness!! You used / in your sentence. So smart!!!! I bet you are the girl that thinks she is the smartest cause she is the loudest.😂 Check it out princess...we all know you aint doing shit. So just sit there and complain like the rest do. Bootleg activist😂😂
@_elenalai
@kiarajonet
Mi hai deluso :( !
@chinkins yes!!! The educational value of these animals is wildly overlooked all due to some bandwagoners believing everything they see on the internet.
All the idiots commenting how bad zoo's and aquariums are also have pets they keep in their homes.  Bunch of hypocrite fools!
Ask him where dory at

@melie_mt first of all, work on your typing skills because idk what your talking about half the time. Second of all, I HIGHLY doubt you’ve done more research or have more personal experience in this field than me.
Hahaha you guys look cute together
@disco_stu_33 Yep, not much we will be able to do with you ay. I’m not the loudest and don’t even think I’m smart, but at least I try (to be smart), you should too! You’ll see it’s not too painful..And even if I was just sitting on my ass complaining, that’d still be more than what you’re bringing to the world mate! Let’s stop there, we won’t get anywhere😅

Hahah. You have the Best personality!!
@reinahroo19 your ignorance is actually incredible! Live in captivity and living longer is a bonus? This is completely unnatural and disgusting yet who call yourself educated based on - they live longer because they are seen to by vets?! They are bred and born into slavery and kept alive as long as possible to profit from and given no freedom to be the individuals they are or even express themselves. Wake up or please shut up because your response is so ignorant it beggers belief
You’ve disappointed me big time @therock 😔
😘
You met my Beautiful Beluga!😍😀
❤️❤️❤️❤️
so cute! i love it ❤️❤️❤️
😍😍❤️❤️❤️
What the fuck you playing at? @therock
@melie_mt y'all are the reason why people need safe spaces. Sensitive ass people. Y'all cry about this but what are you doing about it? Nothing...so shhhhhhh. And who says "oh my word" 😂😂😂😂
@ijustine it is not ‘cute’! It is highly disgusting ☹️😡
His long lost cousin
@chinkins you go girl!! I’m right there with you. Educated people with degrees and personal experience in this field can share all the facts and still haters will hate because they are too stubborn to see the truth and admit they were wrong.
Just playing
I love you bro

@king.jeffolo you can’t fix stupid unfortunately. Her news comes from social media and Netflix “documentaries”

Find beautiful animal, punch beautiful animal. 😳
❤❤❤
He looks so happy to meet you 😍
❤❤❤
@ethically_elizabeth I have done my research, which is why I can correct you on all the bullshit in your comment. What research have you done? 🤔
@melie_mt send me the research you’ve been reading. I’ll let you know if they are reputable. It’s easy to tell. I’ll send you the thousands of peer edited papers I’ve read that actually use the scientific method
@therock they are fantastic animals aren't they? Really are amazing.
@disco_stu_33 You see, plenty of educated/smart/nice people say “oh my word”, and I will always prefer that, than being a bloody insulting person that has 3 words in their vocabulary. Now, what do you know about us and what we do or not against this? And finally, not being ok to be insulted doesn’t mean we’re sensitive people. Just a tad more intelligent perhaps though😘
Thought you were better than this . Do some research ffs.
There are millions of reasons to be in awe of these beautiful creatures which is why we need to protect them. Animal exploitation is real, especially in aquatic parks. They steal babies from the wild, these innocent babies cry, shaking in fear because they’re alone & they have no idea what will happen to them or why they were snatched away from their families. Please don’t promote these places, boycott them & speak up for these beautiful creatures, they need us, especially those with huge platforms like yourself. Be their voice 💔😔
😍
@melie_mt and pharmaceuticals have saved lives. They’ve saved mine.
@melie_mt Yeah I agree, this is wrong but just watch, centuries later when we domesticate these marine animals no one will care. Imagine that, we’ll be having pet marine animals like we have cats and dogs.
@arnyvaneasy take me to meet one!!!
Literally the best animal I’ve ever seen, it’s my nickname cause I have a big head 😆
Thank you for supporting Georgia Aquarium!  That's why we love you!
@chinkins Sure thing! Now, that will be rather a long send and a long discussion, but I’d be happy to have it. This would actually contribute to more the debate forward and educate. Feel free to send me over research and stuff that shows that these animals are better in small swimming pools rather than in oceans that represent 70% of the surface of our planet. Or why some orcas kill themselves. Or why they are so many dead babies, and so many deaths altogether in the captive populations. And why these poor animals are miserable being the scene. And why we need to make them do tricks if we’re only here to “save them”. I could go on and on with my questions, but you know where I’m going.
@kjbrenner lmaoooo hi ily
😍 hermosa foto!
@helloxkimmy you arnt the rock, you would fall in lol
@reinahroo19 I’d rather have my child look into the eyes of a beluga/orca/dolphin and want to protect it and have that emotional attachment. I know the dangers that are in their natural environment due to human activity and it takes one child to be the next Steve Irwin or Jack Hanna.
The rock has been a real insperation to all he's helped me buy getting in the Grove of working out and lifting weights
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
@therock you are so right they are beautiful and intelligent but sadly supporting captivity means more captures of these awesome creatures from the wild.

@melie_mt Dogs were wild animals before we domesticated them.
Do not support this!!! Since you are sensitive enough to admire them, use your power and do something about it. This is not right.

@melie_mt and I have a zoology degree with one of the most reputable universities for animal science/studies. My advisor is on multiple boards of zoos and consistently goes to conferences to continue to learn and teach his students the truth about the industry. Don’t fight with a college educated person on a subject they studied - you’ll just keep digging your hole deeper.
Thank you for your support of these amazing animals!!!
Oh non quelle déception... Ne serait- il pas mieux en liberté...? 😔
People are now complaining about this how long have aquariums been around jesus christ man bet they visit the aquarium themselves
@renplusren haha yeah, centuries ago!! Not much I can do about that mate, but yet, another proof that what we do to the currently still wild animals is wrong! Do you even understand that? Dogs were wild and free and we enslaved them. Now...do you follow or do I need to try to chew it for you even more?

@chinkins well actually no, my dear. See, you can have all degrees you want, and the support for utter hypocrites whom educated you, this will not change the fact that capture, enslave and keep wild animals captive is wrong! I can give you many examples where having degrees doesn’t prove things are right (pharmaceuticals anyone?). You can keep on giving, that’s being hypocrite pure and simple. Degrees or not

please don't support whales in bath tubs :( they belong in the oceon
Gorgeous
Yes they are incredibly intelligent creatures! This is precisely why they should be living in the oceans where they belong, not trapped for entertainment purposes. It's beyond cruel, imagine being locked away from your family for your whole life. Aquariums are hell for non-human animals. Please! I urge you! Rethink this. Do not let the entertainment industry, that you work so hard for, exploit these intelligent loving creatures. They deserve the right to live free happy lives just like us. I believe you are a very compassionate person, so please don't support this. 🌱💜
@shriya_saran1109 Hell no, being in captivity means guaranteed life unlike the wild. The wild is crazy dangerous. Have you not seen the crime rate in oceans? You get eaten just by swimming and minding your own business.
انا بحبك اوي والله العظيم

Thank you for supporting zoos and aquariums, your support is helpful for their work towards conservation and rescue across the board! Sorry you have to get hate comments from uneducated people!
Mr. Johnson, please don't let the animal activists get to you.  The Atlanta Aquarium takes very good care of it's animals, and helps people of all ages learn about these amazing creatures.  I'm so glad you and your family enjoyed it!  I hope you'll have time to visit the Atlanta Zoo as well!  Check out the panda cam at ZooAtlanta.org!

@jasewilson_76 have you ever heard of positive reinforcement? If not, look it up. That’s how they learn how to do the “tricks” that are actually natural abilities these animals have. None of the behaviors hurt them in any way because they naturally can do them, most just don’t know how until the trainers teach them. Just like people learning to do handstands.
OMG cool
@reinahroo19 90% lies? You must be living in a mirror universe. The world around you bombards you with 90% lies since the moment you were born. Wake up.

@alliejmo the word “documentary” is associated with truth and facts. Therefore, it cannot be applied to these FALSE films.
@stefilein77 You are right to speak up for the voiceless. People have no idea the lies we've been fed. Never late the trolls bring you down for the truth will prevail eventually.
@kyanamgervais
Not a good call to promote captive marine life !
@stefilein77 educate yourself; learn to spell

@melie_mt The comments on this thread are so alarming. Is this the future of our planet? I’m utterly shocked by the ignorance.
Always a crack up. ❤ the rock. Ever since "the rock says" days.❤ from nz.
@storiesofbina supporting what Lol
My love
I have witnessed the beluga whale migration in the high Canadian Arctic ....these mammals should not be in swimming pools. I am disappointed that you endorse and promote this. Unfollowing you now.

Jajajajaja
@ethically_elizabeth It is very frightening indeed. But thank you for trying, we need to keep on trying..
Set him free then bro...

Save our wild life from captivity
@Rodriguez_gladys
@reinahroo19 Yep, so that’s what we do with dogs, domesticated animals, for our own comfort you’ll have to admit. Now, whether they are dolphins, sharks, orcas, and all the others, they do, but it is not natural! And how, but how is that helping them to do bloody tricks for ignorant tourists?! HOW?

@reinahroo19 yeah right , statistics lie, they live longer in the wild cuz they're not fuckin depressed trapped in a jacuzzi, what would do if whales kipnap you and take you away from your family for their entertainment? Maybe you're the one that needs education, go watch Animal Planet you fuckin dummy!

@ethically_elizabeth you obviously have no idea what your talking about. First of all, the pools are filled with pure salt water that’s more pure than the salt water in the ocean. Also, if you’re talking about vitamins, then yeah the fish are “medicated” but last time I checked vitamins are healthy soooo 🤷🏽‍♀️ if you’ve eaten fish at a 5 star restaurant then you’ve eaten the same quality fish these animals eat every day.

The Rock still owes me a drink. Taught him everything he knows!
How amazing I would love to do that ! Even just see one fantastic creature ♥️
What’s up with you and albino animals first it was George the albino gorilla what is this ones name
Poor whale he Never would be free :,(
@munoz_1003 jajJajajajajajajaj no mames eres famosa😂😂😂
@shriya_saran1109 Damn right. The hypocricy in the comments here is absurd. Everyone loves whales and other animals but meanwhile enslave and consume them. Who is willing to grand them their rights? It is about time we leave animals alone and off our plates. We're not savages are we?
Some sea life are in life threatening conditions, aquariums nurture them back to health and some are not able to be release back into the open seas. Bot all aquariums are evil. Smh. http://news.georgiaaquarium.org/stories/orphaned-critically-endangered-beluga-whale-calf-rescued-under-247-care-by-marine-mammal-experts

Too big a pay check to say no, huh? You should be at a celebrity status to be able to choose which movie not to act in. This is not a cool co-star.
Whale whale whale...flex off....
Shame on you for promoting Ignorance, pain and separation!
And it's stuck in captivity hmmm
This is so awesome!! So glad you can spread the word about how amazing these animals are!
@shriya_saran1109 well guess who’s NOT gonna be in the Rocks next movie?

@jagentek Dogs are domesticated animals not wild! Man, you’re so ignorant it hurts
@shriya_saran1109 that is so true. As a role model for so many people people such as the rock should be campaigning against captivity of animals. Just watch the documentary blackfish if you are not convinced.

@orangehairlady that’s her cuz she looks so white right?! Or maybe it’s a filter! AAAH
@bradleyabi these babies are not being abused in any way. GAQ is certified by American Humane, AZA, and IMATA which closely monitor treatment of animals. Don’t let biased movies shape your mind without doing your own research. PETA has a mission and they would rather see these babies dead than under human care to where they will flourish and educate many children and adults on how to protect them and their environment.
Then why are you punching it?!?!
this poor little guy is not happy 😡 he should be in the ocean, not in a pool ! we love you @therock and you have fans from all around the world and a huge influence, which is a gift. you inspire young souls and you have the power to make the world a better place, so please use it and don’t support animal cruelty ! 💪🏻🙌🏻👊🏻

@saturnoay sorry If I hurt your feelings. In 2018 I will not be bullied Into stopping things I enjoy. Imagine canceling my membership to the NJ Aquarium or the Zoo. The rock has a right to enjoy. My thing is this. How would we know what animals exist in the world of we dont study them. Or if we dont save them who will... some animals cant live amongst their own. What happend to them. What of they let all the animals and sea animals back I to the wild. What would he the outcome. Specifically of a mother whale killing her offspring for being born with issue. Do we let the mom kill her or abandon her. Or do we raise them up ourselves. Nothing is perfect. AMD no animals should be abused ever. There just has to he ppl that's see both sides of the isle.

@jensau26 nope how many time you open your door and you cat or dog tried to go out. And you say no Duffy. Back up. Let him go. All animals are held in captivity then. What about humans in jail for nothing. Who let's them out. Or when dirty cops set them up and they ate half captive. Why qrejt humans protesting and posting that on IG yes help animals. BUT HELP PPL FIRST.. pick a struggle.
@ohneil28 omggfggg
Is that real
I sure hope the people that are upset about these animals being in captivity dont have any animals in their home living in "captivity" as well (AKA- dogs, cats, birds, etc) because there is no difference.
@shriya_saran1109 😂😂 because you know belugas. Belugas do a behavior called spy-hopping in their natural environment. It’s a very common behavior done by cetaceans. A “high-five” just combines spy-hopping and extending the pectoral flippers...all of which is natural beluga/cetacean behavior. Know your animal behaviors before relying on biased films 😉
You look quite similar hihihi same smile 😍
Well let's hope this isn't another SeaWorld epidemic.🙄

@therock wow ... disappointing! Do some research.  This is the equivalent of you being put in a jail cell your entire life and being forced to perform for food.
No no no! Please remove this! Please look into the #dolphinproject and #seashepherd to understand how these animals end up in captivity! You have such a big voice and are encouraging something that is wrong! Please! Watch The Cove or Blackfish, please educate yourself! Please use your voice to STOP whale and dolphin captivity! @dolphin_project @seashepherd #thanksbutnotanks #saynotothedolphinshow #emptythetanks #shameontaiji #thecove

Disappointed in you. I wish you wouldn’t promote animals being in captivity performing for human amusement. While I appreciate you talking about how intelligent these animals are, and how in “awe” you are of them, I wish you would use your celebrity to promote their freedom and preservation. 🐋🐳🐬🦈🐙🌊. Thank you for considering this suggestion.
@rahfeki you didn't tell me your husband met the rock 😂
Not a fan of this pic. Too bad it’s held captive so the owner can put it on display and make money from it, this is no different than an animal circus which many people find cruel.

@therock As an animal lover, it is really disappointing to see you sharing a picture at an aquarium where these animals are taken from their natural habitat to be watched/interacted with for profit and entertainment. These places are hellholes for these animals who are ripped from their families and sometimes killed in the process, all in the name of greed. You should know better than to use your fame to promote places like this when the goal is to stop attending these places so no more animals need to live a life in captivity. Please consider the power you have and use it for good, not things like this.

@therock I love your passion for life and doing the right thing, being a generally good guy in world of assholes... please do some research into how these mammals are truly treated and hopefully you will treat these amazing beings with more care and compassion. Animals are not here for our entertainment or dinner. I hope that you actually get to read this.
That animal is probably bored to death in its tiny aquarium
@andria_co travelling ie flying polluted this planet you admit you love flying and food but not fish eh . Aquariums help save endangered mammals etc just as zoos save endangered animals like zebra elephants etc they are necessary .

I like you Big Rock ..... but please seriously don’t promote this ... good luck  with everything you are on with ... love and light brother X
I like you really. But that's disapointing. Not funny.  NOT awww. It's fucking captivity in tiny tanks and you support this....

Woaw.....🎶hermoso😜 ❤❤❤
This is sad
@shriya_saran1109 I agree!!👏🏼👏🏼
@rachellpeterss gosh, you are naive. I suppose slaves loved their lives too, right?
Well, this is a great way to sort the wheat from the chaff and unfollow every idiot I was following that I had no idea supported this epic bullshit.
Awwwn
Look at The Rock in the water dappin up the dolphin!
We have Wonderful Aquarium in the ATL! Glad your Family enjoyed your time there!
Super disappointed @therock promoting keeping those in small tanks, doing tricks for food, depressed, c'mon dude.
Beauty in a cage
@leanora.potten
Lindo animal!👊🏼👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Cool
@408.destiiny But the current conversation is specific to the Georgia Aquarium and beluga whales in captivity. I understand the points U are trying to make about sanctuaries, but this particular picture, this particular conversation feed is about the Georgia Aquarium, it’s belugas and their methods of acquiring them. I think that is the frustration of people that u are experiencing and the miscommunications overall.
💙💙
🤣🤣🤣
@fcastjr I'm not mad at him. I'm only stating that promoting this kind of place isn't good.  He's famous and could use his fame to educate others about the horrors of places like this,  but to do that he needs to see these places for what they are. Education is key. I'm hoping he will take the time to learn about the plight of the animals kept here and use this as a platform to educate others.  I have no hate towards him or anyone who doesn't think like me.  I am hoping others will watch Blackfish and make their own decision.
Lovely
😍❤
Well done ✅✅✅✅☕️
@therock please don't promote this horrific cruelty, these animals are kept in conditions can can only be described as torture - They should be in the ocean. Be better than that.
That whale has more intelligence than some of the whales commenting negative crap on your post about you visiting an aquarium! Keep doin you!
Amazing how truly beautiful these animals are
🤢👎
😍😍😍😍😍
Wow awesome
Nice one dear
Rock on
QUIERO SER ESE FUCKING DELFIN
Nice

So cool!
so beautiful
@j_quel_in Bro I’m in love
Why would a whale be in a skyscraper?
Only shame being its in captivity
So cute
@kriskennedyre they were always cool
😻😻
Shame it’s not in the ocean where it belongs
Free Willy!!!!!!
Do you know why you are depressed? @therock  because you don't see a problem in this situations, you don't see problem with imprisoned living beings, that is why
Lovely💗
How are you doing tonight
Cool
Good for you, supporting the protection of sea life.  Don't listen to the haters! Without aquariums and their research, we would not know how amazing these beautiful creatures are. Don't have to lunacy.
Awesome!!!🐳🐋🐳🐋🐳🐋
@rachellpeterss I understand what your point entails. However, there are many instances where these beautiful creatures are caught from the wild and separated from their pods. I believe in rescue and release. This animals stuck in these aquarium the rest of their lives are equivalent to us stuck in a bathtub the rest of ours. How are you sure that the aquariums are helping the animals? I’m sure there are wonderful people out there doing a lot out there to rehabilitate these animals, but they are not meant to be captivated.
@408.destiiny while you mean well your statement is inaccurate. Have you seen what they did to catch it? #saf
ᴏᴏᴠᴇʟʏ.. 😍
How cute!
Dwayne I like the movie skyscraper
Free animals....no captivity’s
Did you just touch her and turn her into Rock? :3
@litter_ystwyth I disagree.... little kid loves the Rock, the Rock loves animals, little kid is inspired by this because he loves animals too. Little kid does really great in school focusing on biology, this young adult is now in college getting a marine biology degree, this adult goes on to help save thousands of species in the wild because we have captive animals to study... Simply stated as Irwin did... we want to save what we love.. I personally am into reptiles. I am a believer that the professional/hobbyist keeper will someday be responsible for keeping certain species alive. Not because of animals be taken unjustly from the wild but because of habitat destruction . I do agree with the idea that if a zoo or aquarium does not have the right facility they should not keep any species of animal.. If these animals were not made available to the public for viewing it would be business as usually.. it helps bring awareness to what humanity is doing to the oceans and creates interest to make changes not just at zoo/aquarium level but globally.

Wooooow
Wuao fantastic
Wooo😯😯
That's amazing!! I love Beluga Whales! So sweet. ♥️
Yes it’s beautiful.  Too bad that is in captivity 😔😔😔😢😭
Disappointing...thought you were too intelligent to support this....
@rachellpeterss the tanks are tiny. The parking lot is 5 times larger than the tanks they are kept in. It's all about making money, not conservation. They shouldn't be breeding them and selling them either. That's not conservation, that's to profit. They die prematurely in captivity for a reason.
Wowowowow wowowowow
I heard animal rights people are hating... Get a life people! I am glad your family had fun!
Oh man, I expected so much better from @therock 😔😞
Q bueno 🐋🐳🐟🐠🐊💕💕💕💕

We 100% understand your awe for belugas. Just like the gorillas you advocated for @rampagethemovie they're extraordinarily complex beings who value freedom just as we do. To truly protect them, respect ➡️ recognition of their #nonhumanrights. Captivity isn't the way. We invite you and the many animal lovers among your  followers to learn more about nonhuman rights and what we're doing to secure them in the US and around the world at nonhumanrights.org!
I LOVE YOU DWAYNE💋💋💋
@fcastjr by paying to see them, he's paying to keep them captive. You vote for the kind of world you want with every dollar you spend.
#abd_Southern perfect 👌
Love them!!! They are my favorite so cool
Your amazing and I love you so much 🔥🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤
@shesings_ox just like no one cared about your opinion on this lmao gtfo

Too bad there kept in a small tank

That's a awesome picture!!!
aww this is so sweet
There are a lot of animals that are nearly extinct and otherwise would be if it weren’t for zoos and aquariums and such. I used to be against these places, but it’s because of these places that some of these animals are even here at all! Wake the hell up people!!!
@vluiz2012 lembrei de vc ... Coisa mais fofa !!! Inveja boa de vcs !
"@celestialkittylover that’s a load of old twaddle. Whales in captivity typically live around a quarter of the life expectancy of those in the wild.

Whales and Dolphins were not designer to be kept in tanks. And they certainly aren’t there to perform tricks.

This has little to do with conservation and a lot to do with profit."
@lai.stergiopoulos
@_varena46 trzdm
@_mrs_shantel__ 😍
@rachellpeterss watch Blackfish and then decide how happy they are to be stolen from their families and forced to perform by being denied food and kept in a tiny tank. These animals live in pods with their families and swim 100's of miles a day.
Awesome 👏
I’m here waiting for Kevin’s face😅
This is the best 👏🏽🐋🐬
@kyle_barton5601
It’s a real shame that you feel it’s ok to visit and then promote an aquarium. These glorious animals should never ever be in these places and these aquariums should never ever be visited. Disappointed in you 😔
@outspokinlvbikeclub so.... maybe he likes it. So what? How about be mad at that place instead of someone who may think and like differently than you?
😢 why you support this cruelty ???
#goals 😢

@antphenderson 👏👏👏
Its amazing !!!
@jenglass
Some animals are put in captivity when babies and are hurt and can't survive in the wild so some may have been there long enough to not know how to survive alone and yes some might see this photo as animal cruelty and some might not.
@therock It’s bigger then @kevinhart4real

Amazing!!

@shriya_saran1109 you have a fragile mind. Get over it
Yes they are great indeed . But they are kept in concrete tanks and taken from their families , kept hungry so that they can perform tricks . And sometimes over bred and then sold too other parks .So please Dwayne don’t go too the aquariums . It then supports the other people too.
E muito amor envolvido!
It sure knows what the Rock is cookin’ 🤨 🐳 🐂
@elementarycrossfit
@sharonperera1989  The aquariams are helping the animals. Do you not get that the animals there were rescued because they were injured. They are very happy in the aquariams and love the people they work with. If only people like you could see that.
Wow impressive
@therock #captivitykills #boycottzoosandaquariums
This photo make me feel so sad :(.... why are you promoting this kind of activities? It’s true that maybe the y are not injured or suffering violence... but the y don’t Belong there.. they are not clowns.
Astonishing😍👍
Oxm 😘
@kevin020173 You’re the epitome of selfishness for actually believing we have a right to capture, enslave and exploit other species. The learning/educational card is see through it’s worn so thin. Try getting some knowledge about how these animals live NATURALLY and kill your own ignorance. And don’t attribute quotes to Morgan Freeman or Albert Einstein till you know 100% that they ever said it.
@ashleyknunez

@litter_ystwyth her sentence is more complete than you life

@xazrairem ama ich hab 4 kilo abgenommen

@flackeezy  Lies. How do you know they are sad, have they told you. If you go to Sea world and watch a show you are able to see how happy the animals are their. They're safe, well treated, and love their trainers. They we're rescued and now brought back to help thanks to aquariams.
@iokau900 THIS is not teaching people about wildlife.
@mlnbrwnl yesss! He‘s the best!
All I’m waiting for is @kevinhart4real ‘s comment 🤣🤣
Seeing Rock evertime is like seeing a perfect example of being a perfect human being on this earth, I personally adore you.
@litter_ystwyth ok. Live by that statement and refuse all advancement in medical science and treatment for you and your loved ones made from studying these great animals in the wild and in controlled environments. See how quickly you eat your ignorant words as family members suffer in agony or die at early ages because you think it unfair to the animals.

@rachellpeterss Oh that’s ok then, we’ll hunt them and hit them with our motorboats and propellers till someone says, oooh put them in captivity so we have 5 left to gawk at. Yeah, that’s really holistic 🤣
@hollyrogan I know :( but he’s so cute! I wanna cuddle xo
Such a shame this beauty is in captivity
@_varena46 * 3 kilo
@kjbrenner I just want to play with aquatic animals all day long
😲😲😲
Beautiful 😄😍
@stilettoqueenjj DUDE these animals are even sometimes killed when they are captured. And over bred in aquariums and sell them just for money ! It is very unnatural for these animals to act like this . NO ONE deserves too be kept in a concrete tank and perform 3 times a day . ITS THE TRUTH MAN #savebelugas
Sir, he should be in the wild.
@usrfd1212 Heard that same sorry BS justification for decades mate, you guys are like stuck records. I suffer from illness actually and don’t rely on medicines.

Cute
For someone who has Samoan ancestry, you sure show little respect for your ocean brothers and sisters. You realize these creatures did not choose a life of confinement and exploitation?
😍😘lindo😍🤗🤗
If you were in such awe you’d know there is nothing cool about captivity. The animals belong in the ocean NOT in a swimming pool!
@charles_brownbritsommelier I didn’t know you met the rock
👌🏾👏🏾
@lilian_pumpernickle 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️😒
That whale is yoked
Look...it's a Airbus ✈
@therock how would you like it (you wouldn’t) if you were stolen from your natural environment or ripped from your mother and thrown into captivity and forced to entertain the masses and take selfies???!!! Great lesson to teach your child.
They dosen't belong in captivity.
👍👍👍👏👏👏👏🎊🎊
@bradleyabi I support your words. Well done.
Get over yourself people he’s enjoying a day with his family, not glorifying or condoning animals in captivity. Got damn you overly sensitive Lil shits.  do any of you complainers do anything to make a difference in these animals lives ??? I’ll wait ??? You probably don’t you just sit on here or face book waiting to bash and bully people. Shame on you.

Wow....would love to have this experience

Please let the beluga go free.
Omgggghh its a baluga!!!!!!!!! I love balugas!!!!!
Fighter
You should not support this! It's cruel and I recommend you to watch a documentary or read about this to form your on opinion. If you do support it after that then you're just an asshole🤷🏼‍♀️
This place does a lot of rehabilitation for sea life so quit bashing mr Johnson people. Do your research
Very VERY sad 👎
No. There's other ways to show and animal in a movie. Like CGI....so over animals used for entertainment. It's 2018 the technology is there.
@glitterqueen81  show this to Charlie!
That is so cute
Awesome
Hey are you make the sound of Maui from Moana you're a good player of Moana OK I watch what are you doing really good to the song and the boys just trying to meet you and I live in Las Vegas OK bye
@shriya_saran1109 Do you not get that these aquariams are helping the animals. They also love it there and are friends with their trainers. They are not in captive.
Poor animal in captivity 😭
@stefilein77 You must be a millennial with your fragile always offended mind. Don’t attack the rock like this. Uncalled for
@geekvip You’re the one who needs educating about the rights of other species to live free, wild, unhindered and unexploited by naked apes who think they own everything. I’ll keep tearing that shit down for the voiceless as long as I have breath, YOU are dead wrong.
Is that a six pack I see on that Beluga?? 🤣 might be some competition!  Of course, if Beluga does co-star with you, graphics guys can cgi a cute plump midsection for him.
Such a cruel practice. Torn from their families. Please do not support this cruelty 😒😕
Wow.  I'm shocked to see @therock supports this. Shame on you

#captivitykill #emptythetanks
@ortizlily2004 @geekvip actually, you guys need to educate yourselves and watch “Born to be free” it’s a documentary on how these animals were brought there and the inhumane practices behind it. Many belugas captured die and the aquariums just go out and get more to replace the dead ones. These animals are one of the few that do not do well in captivity. Alongside dolphins and orcas. I’m not trying to start an argument, just trying to educate those on what isn’t known
@ramfrancov jajajajajjajajajjajajajaj
@courtycourtttt
Lovely
In don’t want to be that person, but have you seen Born to be free?
Wish everyone commenting on how horrible this pic is would quit with the internet warrior mentality and research a little. Do you realize the @georgiaaquarium has partnered with many conservation organizations to help understand what could be threatening the species? And to work towards sustaining their future? @therock - Love the picture!
Very Nice photo 😊
@atiamaior you are in the comment section, bitching just because a celebrity wants to see some fucking animals, do you want him to just go find them out there in the ocean? They are already in captivity he just wants to admire them
Belleza¡¡¡!!!♥️♥️♥️♥️
Bello❤️😍👏👏👏😍
Wow beautiful Beluga.
So cool!  Looks like you had a great time!! I wish the activists would leave you alone, ROCK, these bad comments are just dumb!! I can’t believe others feel they have to use celebrity to make a statement.  If you wanna protect animals stop wasting all your time dumping on people that just want to do fun stuff with their families and do some real work!!
Let it free
@therock That’s shocking... Whales belong in the wild, I’m sorry but for me that is a Reason to unfollow you. Hope you’ll see one day that This is A very bad example, for anyone, but espacially for you becouse so many people admire you. I really do hope you’ll change your mind about This..

I am SO SO relieved to see the majority of people here are educated and absolutely against keeping animals, including marine animals, in captivity. It’s a real shame to see you taking part in this cruelty and ignorant mistreatment, so disappointing @therock 😣😔😔

@shriya_saran1109 Do you know the circumstances how this mamal got to the aquarium? That should be the first thing to reasearch because most aquariums rescue and help saving the lives of marine animals that are wounded in their habitat. And the revenue usually goes to keep this animals safe.
💪💪
Beautiful 👌
Very cool
So beautiful 😍, only they need to be free where they belong
#boom

No please, not in aquarium!!!! Please don’t support this!
@giovanavelardi @fer_velardi o the rock também é conhecido como dwayne johnson, assim como a beluga também é por narval. coincidência? eu acho que não
@shriya_saran1109 you need to educate yourself better.  By going here his family is supporting the welfare of these animals.  He is supporting the rescue efforts of these aquariums.  These aquariums educate people and encourage them to donate to causes that help the animals.  I’m really sick of seeing people like this dismiss good people who are doing good things for our environment and animals.  You are absolutely dead wrong.  The Georgia Aquarium is beautiful and they do wonderful things to help the animals in our oceans.  People need to not be deceived by inaccurate posts like this that try to tear down a very good thing.
Brutal
@bradleyabi 👏
@alenavazo jajaja!!!
I love beluga whales
Es de verdad?
Wow GG MaN √√√
Buddyyyyy
Is this the movie u play youself?
Omg, are people seriously getting on this man for visiting the aquarium??? Haha I just saw pics of jlo visiting Wild Life in Sydne. I’m sure if you google celebs visiting zoos or aquariums you will find more pics. Yes I love animals and don’t want to see them in captivity but you cannot be mad at this man for going to an aquarium.... haha... if that’s the case then you need to go there yourself and picket to every family that walks in.  @therock you will never be able to make everyone happy... you do you.
@flackeezy Support aquariums and the rescue and recovery efforts they represent that the person who posted this apparently knows nothing about.
That's one big boy
Awwww
Nice pic look
@disco_stu_33 lovely. Actually every piece of makeup I own is cruelty free. But thanks
So cool!
@alenavazo 👉😮👈
Hola
@bradleyabi black fish didn’t prove anything and it’s basically radical animal activist who did more harm than good.  I didn’t contradict myself because quite honestly studying them in the wild is far more dangerous for those who were made to rule over them...humans.
Wowww❤
Don't worry about the critics therock. you can't fix stupid.
@claire.vegan I saw. So sad. Hopefully @therock sees how exploitative this is and speaks out against it and never supports places that holds animals captive for profit again.
Y’all are ignorant af do your research. Intelligent species should not be held captive and made to perform tricks for crowds. How do you think they learned those tricks it’s not all smiles it’s cruel training and conditions.
It should be in the ocean , swimming freely
@flackeezy  How about we boycott the use of celebrity to make a statement!! I go to aquariums and zoo’s and no one complains about my post!! Use another outlet and stop abusing the popularity of others!! The Rock did nothing wrong, he was just spending time with his family. Or, maybe you should just get real life and stop worrying about everyone else’s!!
So awesome!!

Whales should never be in captivity in a tank @therock you should know better. How would you feel if you were only allowed to workout, shoot a movie, in one room for the rest of your life? Someone took your family, friends away. Then people came by to say high and take a selfie while you’re stuck in you’re little cage. You’d go mad. #thinkaboutit #whenyouknowbetteryoudobetter
Even sea life is honored to meet The Rock 😂🤘🏽
👎 This is very cruel. Life is so sad that so many animals in captivity have to be free in their natural habitat. What a disappointment that you support animal abuse. one less fan ⬇️
Just horrible, use animals to make money...not cool at all !!
Great Sir
woww 🐋🐋😍😍
Not cool!!!
Ohhhhh i cannot....im craving to swim with a dolphin <3 <3 <3
:'( It breaks my heart to see that you support captivity... I admired you for sooo many years, and hope you educate yourself on the plight of captive mammals, and the torture they have to endure so that people like you can take a photo like this.
Love this picture!
😡🤬😡🤬😡 stop animal abuse!!!!
@sheilahanney Hi there, most people belong in the wild. When I say jealous In referring to the fact that The Rock is there,  and some people wish they could be there too
Cool

@shriya_saran1109 ur a SELFISH nut & a troll! HOW R INNER CITY CHILDREN or the less fortunate than U, going to know & appreciate these creatures? Aquariums r a learning tool! “Knowledge never hurt anyone but ignorance kills”~ Morgan Freeman
Yeah
👍🏼👌🏼
Easy to go see these beautiful animals in captivity what's harder is to be an advocate for them. Please @therock do the research and see for yourself. #boycottseaworld #emptythetanks #captivitykills #blackfish🐳🦈🐋🐬🐳🐬🐟🐋
Oh for Pete's sake.  Everyone needs to get their knickers out of a knot.  He isn't the one keeping them in captivity, nor did he put them there.  If anything, he drew attention to your cause.  You know, life is a lot happier when you're not spending your time looking for people and things to be offended by.
Here come the “it belongs in the ocean it was stolen” people
People just need to stop does anyone ever think that maybe so of Mammals are safer where they are just because other wise humans would hunt to extinction, and that is by killing on purpose or the Chemical spills the trash been thrown in the oceans you act like you care and you want the animals to be free but yet nobody hardly does anything to help these poor animals, and quick to bash a father for having time spent with his kids, well look at your on Family members no one is not guilty of take their family , kids to a Zoo animal park ect , so stop living in others peoples lives and live yours and help to humans on land also to have a better life also
@therock out of everyone i wouldn’t expect you to support animal captivity it is horrible and needs to be stopped you are just as bad as the people putting them in the tanks by supporting it
Great, but don't forget you are where you should be while you co-star , dat Beluga whale, isn't where it should be. There's more you could do than a handshake n photo-op.
@therock
Aww so cute!!!!!
Supporting cruelty. What a horrible thing. 🤮
No fair!!!! You get to play with a Beluga!! Looks like the best time EVER!!
Shame on you
Wow that's awesome
#blackfish
Que foto más chula
Cool 😎
Que  belleza 😍😍😍
Post a pic of you eating a nice fat tuna steak with some asparagus. The asparagus was screaming when it died!
All the fake accounts just to make a post lol how childish are you all. Its a great moment. Some of these animals weren’t even born in wild and would have no clue how to even survive in it.
@leynapls
Free him or her !!!!!
Amazing
Yes but you should check out their sleeping "quarters "they have for them. Hopefully it's not like Seaworld😞
Not good @therock, this beautiful animal should be in the wild!
FOR ALL YOU LIBERAL ANIMAL RIGHTS IDIOTS - STFU 99% OF THESE ANIMALS MUST BE KEPT HERE TO ENSURE THIER SAFETY AS THEY ARE SOMETIMES ILL OR UNABLE TO LIVE IN THE WILD - LEARN SOMETHING BEFORE U OPEN UR MOUTH AND SHOW YOUR TOTAL IGNORANCE
I was disappointed to see this
Such a beautiful animal. Needs freedom
Oh shit. Boy fist bumped a dolphin.

@pappiwhoo ok, im literally dead rn!😂😂😂😂
@alishahillstyle I thought I tagged you in this. I saw a movie being filmed by my hotel and wondered if it’s him. I might have to find him. I mean my sons name is Dwayne too so we are sure to have a instant connection. 😂😂😂 look at all his other pics from the aquarium, he and his fam got the royal treatment and it looks awesome. We need to find him so we can dress his wife and daughters for red carpets, being her to our showroom. I mean it is next to the aquarium. 🤷🏼‍♀️
While I do think that it's cool to get the chance to see these amazing animals up close, they are much better off in their environment. They aren't creatures for entertainment. Marine biologists can study them from afar, and people can probably dive with them, but those tanks are way too small, and whales are social/familial creatures. No tank can be as good as the ocean unless it is the ocean.

Can put in a new character in your next rampage 2 movie.... Must be awesome!!
Beautiful in the wild!!! Not in captivity. Pfff, get yourself educated please, before promoting captivity.

omg the georgia aquarium treats their animals amazingly... Jesus people can't even go to the aquarium without people getting mad ?!
#emptythetanks 😪😪
I love you therock
@shriya_saran1109 agree 💯 % 💦🐋🐳🐬💦
So many butthurt so called “adults” saying how horrible this is. You all point your dirty fingers up your own butts. Complain complain complain. It was one day at an aquarium. Idiots
@therock i love you and have mad respect for you. I see ever single one of your movies..... but this just broke my heart. These incredibly intelligent creatures know they’re captive, live a horrible depressing life where they’re mistreated and abused to do these silly tricks for the joy of stupid fucking humans. You can reach out to so many people and give people knowledge rather than encourage this. Please.
Wow! Adorable ✌
@saturnoay plants have feelings to biiiitch!!
@therock wow what an amazing beauty.
Wow....that’s awesome!
Wow!  Beautiful!!!
so cute ❤️😍
@therock youre awesome brother and an AMAZING role model. I've loved and respected you forever now and love your work. But please, please! read up on sea animals in captivity. If you haven't, start with reading up on the dolphin that played "Flipper." Animals like this have the cognitive capacity to understand that they are being held captive and many have, under their own willpower, held their breaths, refused to breath and COMMITTED SUICIDE in their tanks. Flipper did it in the arms of his/her trainer. Afterwards he (the trainer) turned into one of the biggest activists against capturing and keeping ocean animals for entertainment.

Cool picture
These cannot just be turned back to the oceans immediately, but can with being monitored. We can stop capturing others tho-we can stop importing and caging in the future. We can view these by programs on tv but they shld not be kept in captivity and used to entertain by doing what we think is so “cute”. Sad indeed
No lie
@ezhil_blake yeah you right, them sea ghosts are spooky af

Pauvre bête dans un aquarium 😞ça me fend le coeur 💔

It's ok to have fun with your family at Sea World, Dwayne.  Some people feel like they've wasted their day if they don't tell somebody they're living their life wrong !  They're probably vegan.
Horrible .
@bradleyabi I bet your makeup routine is a cruel routine. But here you are fucking us off with your mug.
🔥😍
Would be more amazing if that whale was swimming free. Not in captivity for human entertainment.  #justsaying
Come on Rock. With all the good you do and can still do you should be opposing these kinds of facilities. Millions of people look up to you and you can and do make a difference in the world so as a role model you need to do so in every aspect. These types of facilities are horrific for these beautiful and intelligent animals. #emptythetanks
Winter 3? :0
How can you support this, it’s absolutely disgusting... so disappointing. Poor enslaved creature 😞

How fun!!
Hi Dvaine,it is cool
OMG soo cute❤❤😍
Lol! How precious!!!
😍😍
👌
OMG so cool
@redden12301 so, these beautiful creatures should be held captive against their will and deprived from their natural habitat just so that humans can see the marine life? I'm happier watching them swim freely on TV. Smh.
Dude, captivity is not cool..

What a great picture 😍😍
@juhan_hong
@sophie1990pipe it is our responsibility to care for animals. That’s what we do, and that’s what people who love animals intend to do. I agree that animals are better left alone, and I wish we could leave more of them alone. At this point, we are racing to save many of them and leaving them alone means letting them die out, because we have failed to be good stewards. You and I can have different perspectives on the Bible, but when I use those words it isn’t from a place of ignorance and nonsense. Peace.
@therock That animal has spent its life stuck in a enclosed pond doing tricks for food when it is supposed to have the entire ocean and it’s freedom. Admire you a lot but please don’t visit aquariums anymore, no matter how much BS they tell you about their “conservation and rescue” efforts. @animaljusticeproject

Please stop supporting this crap! They are not “conservationists” they are purely for profit.
You’re a real life Dr Dolittle @therock ... animal, vegetable or mineral... think you can put a smile on anybody’s face...thanks for being around brother 🤟🏽👊🏽
@bradleyabi combined with the aquarium studies has provided more than the pure study of the wild would be able to
Why is the Beluga wearing a Blue Tshirt & shorts? Put a Shirt on Dwayne looking soft Braah! @therock
😂😂😂
No no No, these creatures aren't in there natural habitat and are made to perform for profit, this is abuse.  Please educate yourself and others. #captivityiscruel  #captivitykills 🚫🚫🚫 @therock
Is that real
Finding dory xD
@mike_nyc_4evr you can study them in the wild closely without subjecting them to evil. Contradicted yourself there regarding abuse my friend. However, if you still need convincing I highly recommend you watch both Blackfish and The Cove. I’m sure then you’ll believe differently.
Wow how cool
⚡❤👍
I love you, but please dont promote captivity!

@17indicolite you seem to have a different view of what “ruler” means than I do. Ruling over someone or something doesn’t mean inherent cruelty or pride. If that is what it connotes for you, so be it, but that is not what I was implying. Disgusting arrogance lol right.

@shriya_saran1109 I agree Im against anything like this I would go to any sea worlds!! BUT some are ocean aquariums which are for whales and dolphins etc... which have been held in captivity for so long  and can’t fend for them self anymore.
Sweet
AMAZING ! 😝🙏
Que bello momento
He’s begging you to take him back to his family in the MF ocean, Rock. Come on, you’re smarter than promoting captivity for profit.

@maddihenderson you say to #geteducated , right? well then you should know that this specific aquarium is known for importing captured beluga whales. while i do understand that there are many places that house and take care of animals that can no longer survive in the wild, those places are called sanctuaries and not all aquariums/zoos are like that. even if this whale was not captured or bred for the sole purpose of being in an aquarium, they should not be training it to do ‘cool tricks’ to entertain humans. the rock displaying this to a bunch of people makes me sad, but i am also happy to see a lot of people mad about it, and i’m glad for the opportunity to reply to you and share my opinion just as you did.

Wild animals live in wild places not cages,
@bradleyabi science research will teach us how to live together with them and the only way to do so is to study them closely. I do not BELIEVE they are being abused. Also in those countries where they are being abused; you cannot assume ALL ZOOS AND AQUARIUMS do the same.
They look so huggable..

@shriya_saran1109 is it natural for dogs to be taught to sit, give paw, fetch sticks, stand on hind legs, etc? And in your mind does the vast majority of owners know that teaching these are not the dog natural behavior? Is it unfair to the dogs? They should be left alone roaming the streets, chase after and bite kids and people if it feels like it eh? They should be allowed to breed and grow in packs so that stray dogs can rummage through all the garbage in the city creating mess. They should be allowed to after all this is their natural behavior. Why should we neuter them? Isn't it cruel? I mean us doing all this is not fair to them too right? All dogs must be left to roam everywhere unleash. If humans come face to face with a pitbull and get chowed, we should let nature takes it course. After all we are talking about fairness and natural behavior.

@fcastjr READ my written words properly. I did not do anything of the sort. You are projecting. I wrote one respectful phrase for the innocent soul very peacefully. Check yourself bc you just wrecked yourself. I didn’t tell anyone what to do nor did I criticize. However, that’s what you’re doing which makes zero sense. Simmer down.
In awe at the size of this lad, absolute unit
Sad. Though I’m happy to see so many comments attempting education to individuals who are still unaware of the cruelty regarding these beautiful creatures. We are slowly moving forward. Awareness is spreading. They should not be locked up. Unfortunately I will be unfollowing, and I hope that the Rock and others will soon open their hearts and minds. ❤️
So awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
@therock it looks like you had a wonderful day! Don't let harsh words or differing opinions get to you. We all have our opinions and it's great that we can express them freely. However, it is sad when a simple day out with family is criticized. I think that you are a great human being and keep being awesome! 👍👍

Yeh dude
Mr. Johnson, I am a biologist and physician and a human profoundly concerned for our environment and the best conditions for all life and I can see that you are in awe of these fabulous creatures and the magnificence of life.  It is so obvious from your pics that there is nothing more than admiration in your generous sharing of these fun photos of your visit to the aquarium.  I am so sorry for you or anyone who is taken advantage of by a group who is only invested in promoting their own agenda in every breath they take.  Just as when “you are a hammer everything looks like a nail”, these hate mongers and fallacious zealots only have a pejorative focus and thus; constantly attempt to force their negativity down every body else’s throats.  Dwayne, if possible, try to remember your truth, not theirs.  You looked like you were a delighted kid excited to learn about and interact with some seriously amazing mammals that are so rare for any of us to have the opportunity to interact with.  I am personally having a brighter day after viewing your instagram photos.  Fortunately, I have the incredible ability to see your terrific shared photos for what they are.  Furthermore, I can also easily dismiss ludicrous and/or outrageous people and their comments, especially when they jump on the back of a celebrity whose actions mean nothing but benevolence not malevolence.  To the Georgia Aquarium, you rock!  I love Beluga whales and you have a lovely exhibit.  To these pernicious, abhorrent worms trying to darken something that comes from light:  blow off and get a life!  If that is not possible, try to act in a civil manner and exhibit restraint.

Oh boohoo listen to all the bleeding heart softies. Has it crossed ur minds that maybe just maybe having some in captivity has kept them alive and from being poached! No it probably hasn’t instead of trying to shame someone for going to an aquarium to see these beautiful animals and let their children see them before the human race wipes them out completely u should stop to consider that their is nothing wrong with having some n captivity. So many species are being killed if we can save some of them by having them in an aquarium i don’t see why we shouldn’t.

#EmptyTheTanks - educate yourself. These animals are too intelligent and emotional to be kept in captivity!
@thejadedone72 not jealous, these animals belong in the wild that's all
@karen.fonseca.5 besta kkkkkk
So sad. So disappointing 💔💔
Meet Rick O' Barry before doing this. 🙏🏼✨
Why do they look alike though...
😍😍
@miss_nikki_z lol the caption
Rampage was awesome
Love!
Aquariums are prisons 😔 wish u wouldn't support stuff like this @therock
Handsome Brown Finds A Smart New White Friend👍fab post 🤟😉
That poor animal has been poked, prodded, tortured into giving you that high five @therock just remember that.. tortured.
seriously?? So disappointed 😡😡😡
@therock im sure the Beluga feels the exact same way about you hahaha

@mike_nyc_4evr I don’t have either. But regardless, you cannot compare the two. These beautiful animals swim for hundreds of miles everyday in the wild, yet in captivity they are subjected to these tiny concrete prisons.
🐳🐋💙❤
That's Awesome , Man 😀😀😀😀
@rosangeles01 lame!!! must go back
You are the best of the world,respect from Romania...
Wow..wko...awesome wow..how beautiful
@elrorohx  we aca esta tu beluga ahre
Why don't you support a sanctuary that doesn't allow human touch and sees for the welfare of the animals only? Oh that's right you wouldn't get your "cute" selfie...
🐋🐳🐬
Nice#
Lawlz😂🤣
@jensau26 wow since the Rock went to visit these amazing creatures,  it must be right.... I’m going to show my support to these amazing Aquariums..... thanks to you nutty people,  makes me want to support them that much more
"Seriously in awe of these creatures...
Are you joking!!! Not that much in awe considering your happy to see them held in tanks and kept against their will 😡"
Wawww
@xanarchy.011
Georgia Aquarium must have paid loads of money for these posts... 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
So disappointing! 😫 That beautiful whale belongs in its natural environment - not an aquarium! Please use your fame and status as a hero more responsibly.

@jaydenrufugio again I’m a vegan but when did I say I was perfect? I had my cats before I became vegan by the way! ✌️
Good vibe
@shriya_saran1109 OMG!!! Can’t a man take his family to see some animals and have some great family time without you people being all judgmental ?? What the hell!! Shame on you!
☺☺
Very Cool!
The KING IS ROCK
That’s soo cool
🐳💗🐋💖🐬💕💞😍
Is that real?
To all of you Hypocrites giving #therock ceao for enjoying a weekend with his family at an aquarium. If you are all honestly concerned about nature and the planet, then make an example by not using fossil fuels or even eat and should just starve yourselves since you're all also contributing parties to other "negative effects" on this planet.
Great
😱❤️❤️❤️
He’s probably smarter than most of the actors and actresses in Hollywood.....🤣🤣🤣
The Rock just made camo cargo shorts cool again! @brent_willcutt
Great photo @therock !! I sincerely apologize for the judgy people commenting. I think it’s nice to see a man take his family for an outing!
Hey rock, I saw that people were giving you crap just because you posted pics on Instagram. I really believe that’s inconsiderate of them and they need to leave well enough alone. Your an awsome person and I really enjoy your movies!! I have your back ROCK!!
oh nooo...the white rock
💙
@mad_bananasss 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ honestly!!! I do yes!! A cat that chose to live with us.. I feed it and care for it but it turned up on our door and is free to leave when ever it wants!! The difference here my sweet is these animals haven’t been ‘rescued ‘ they have been stolen from the ocean and they cannot get back..
maybe if there gonna be a rampage part2 he should be d next or new george??
😍😍😍
Seriously cool
Reminds me of my kindergarten teacher and the book about the beluga whale. And I'm 30.
👏👏🏿
#captivitykills
Watch The Cove @therock. You'll never support them in captivity again. 😞😭😰
@rakesh__29__ kya hogaya re
How cute
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤👌👌👌
Welcome to Georgia!
😍😍👏👏
I can’t wait to see the movie you will be  in  with such a beautiful animal that exists such as thy beluga whale
Very poortaste
@mad_bananasss Huge difference in keeping a creature like a dog to trying to replicate the bloody ocean!!! Whales do not thrive in swimming pools!
@alves_bn
yes it's beautiful but it's also caged up instead of being free
Cmon Rock you have the reach to stop this!! You’re so good at getting people to mobilize, please help stop this cruel practice - you’re the man!
Very poor taste. Who is advising you?
Awsome!!!!!!
@lugobugo te ce volevo tragga io! Secondo te gli ha menato davvero?
Cute
@shriya_saran1109 🔝🙌🏼

I think the Beluga has more hair 😁
Thise animals should be with their family
Poor animals.. rock you should not promote these horrible acts! Animals should be in their habitat..
@jessdowman_ 😂😂😁
@sir_nilsso
Wow impressive
This is amazing!!! @therock you are living your best life 🤙🏻🤙🏻

@ashleyabruner He’s not that much smaller than a WHALE. The Rock is a BEAST!
Stolen from their family and living in a tiny pool 😡😔
The great Actor ever
@usrfd1212 how about the advances to medical intelligence and insights provided by studying them in the wild!
Negative comments suck, he’s just having a good time.
@cassiablue_ eu 😂
👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 that’s pretty fucked up @therock ....Instead of promoting captivity why don’t you educate the masses on how these animals are mistreated and don’t belong in cages.

@shriya_saran1109 oh well.... if you don’t like it,  too tough for you.... go find a safe space to cry in....
@therock that's sounds cute playa. They were still kidnapped and taken against their will. They are still being inslaved and jailed. They should be free with their families not captured and force to live in a tank.
😍😍😍😍
I just loved
@usrfd1212 to me being a vegan means doing the least harm possible, I never said I was perfect! Have a good day 😃

What's up with all the butt-hurt libtards whining about this?
@shriya_saran1109 Well said!!! His endorsement just encourages more people to think that keeping these amazing intelligent creatures in a swimming pool is ok! @therock
@ambredrz ouiii 😍
Please don’t support aquariums! No wild animal deserves to be kept in a cage or concert fish tank for the sake of human greed!
Beyond sad! Unfollowing. #emptythetanks 💔
♥️❤️💕
Don’t do this... I thought you were better than this.
@urmilagoldberg so go protest the place that's holding them. Who are you to berate someone who is having a good time? You dont like something, great, doesn't mean EVERYONE must dislike what you dislike. World doesn't revolve around you and your beliefs.
How sad that you use your platform to show support for such cruel practices. These mammals should be free in the ocean not confined to a tank for your entertainment. How depressingly ignorant #emptythetanks
@therock Moana II
It’s beautiful 😍
Very nice

@missy_jski stop owning pets.
@shriya_saran1109 the aquarium he’s at is notorious for rescuing hurt and endangered animals to help them rehabilitate. Quit being a fucking sheep and actually do your own research instead of letting a bunch of people on IG call you a retard
waiting 😞
Love it man!  That whale looks happy!

Awwwww,,........some
I’m surprised you’d support an aquarium! These animals should be free not in tanks for our amusement!
@therock as many others have said captivity is wrong on many levels, please just a quick google search of this aquarium reveals the many complaints about it and many beluga deaths, would rather see you supporting the end of captivity than promoting it!
💕
Lovely
@therock you rock!!!!!!!!

I used to support the Georgia Aquarium. I swam in the big tank with the whale sharks and had a private dolphin encounter. More recently, the Georgia Aquarium has proved themselves inept by having more than one Beliga calf die. I simply cannot support this place any more. It's a cute photo op, but it doesn't change the facts.

"DJ, thanks for supporting the aquarium - I just started following to contest the flack you’ve been receiving. 
https://www.georgiaaquarium.org/conserve/rescue-and-rehabilitation"
@bluepurpose
I love
@maddihenderson well it's probably because you're wrong. You said "it's illegal to take animals from the wild now so all people can do for now is take care of the ones who were already stolen from the wild." 1) people still take animals from the wild as long as there is a demand for them, legal or not. Popularizing posts such as this only encourages that. 2. That does not address the fact that people breed wild animals for captivity. 3. "Taking care of the ones who were already stolen" does not include teaching them to do stupid tricks, pose for photos, or otherwise interact with the general public.
@diva_glitterbitch Aaw this is so cute!
Great. Not only do French bulldogs die in your “care” but you love aquariums.
Glad you had a great day with family and friends. As we know everyone always has something negative to say. I seen no wrong in your photos !

😓😢sad that you would post this photo
@shriya_saran1109 of fuck off
It's very sad to saw that amazing animal in captivity
Here you see the majestic beluga whale in its natural habitat and The Rock punching the sh*t out of it to assume dominance.
Hmm
Awesome having a whale 🐳 of a time! 😃🤣💪🐳

What beauty
@melodiecau en vraie c’est putzins de pas beau
Beautiful, i love you 😍❤
Super. Cool
@redden12301 why has status got anything to do with stealing animals from their natural environment and keeping them captive because it’s too expensive to see them in the wild! That’s selfish to the core and barbaric!! I don’t have to explain my position to you and I live in the now and don’t need to explain anything anyone in the past did because everyone should be responsible for their own actions! The colour of my skin and the money in my pocket does not define me.. what defines me are my actions & I choose to be a voice for those who cannot speak!!!!!
@shriya_saran1109 Wow, you think he ordered this whale to be out in there, just chill for one sec
OMG, que hermosa foto 😘
@saturnoay Cats. Dogs, Snakes and birds are also held in captivity by human in their homes. Leave them on the street the too can die. Bring them home or on a facility willing to keep them it's called captivity. Pick a struggle
@thecoltjohnson Many facilities do in fact use chlorine, regardless of the filtration system, most notably smaller animal abusement parks like our local facilities, the Miami Sea Prison. Without sterilization methods (including chlorinization), the pools would be murky and bacteria laden. Regardless of the water quality, it’s abuse and there’s no disputing that. If people stopped supporting these vile industries, they wouldn’t steal animals from the wild and they would go out of business.
@mis.maylen weeeeon una beluga con la roca 😍 que cosa más maravillosa

Hah
@dixiek4 omg
so adorable,we should protect them
@ed.tankersley you mean people who ACTUALLY care about an animal’s well-being...?
I suddenly feel the need to hug that cute whale
@thecoltjohnson Exactly. Nothing is natural in captive facilities and methods like chlorinization are used to reduce fecal bacteria in the water. Please do not support these facilities. They steal animals from the wild so they can exploit them for profit.

So cool!!! I love the GA Aquarium
So cool!!! I love the GA Aquarium
I feel like celebrities with big platforms such as @therock should speak up about how much of an impact we have on these vastly intelligent cetaceans. Orca and whales are being poached, hunted and taken from their pods. Is this headline news? All we see is, models in bikinis and how much a celebrity spent on a new Ferrari... these fragile creatures depend on their family for survival, they reach them paramount skills for independence and how to catch food. They are not getting this in captivity.
Good bless the rock

So disappointed
@shriya_saran1109 no by posting this pic it shows family time.. stop trying to bully and shame ppl into you world. What if they decide today to let all the animals there into the sea.. guess what THEY'LL DIE!!
Bosss....
💕
@nadiasorial meeee jjjjaja
@ethically_elizabeth I'm not debating the fact that they profit from the animals. I'm debating your statement of aquariums using Chlorine in their salt water systems. They don't, the only shred of evidence of that is from documentary film Blackfish, which had no actual proof, and they profited from the movie... Just sayin... Sea world for example uses 62 individual filters, capable of filtering nearly 81,000 gallons of salt water per minute. That’s 132 million gallons of salt water recycled and reused every day. At no time does SeaWorld ever cross water between systems or tanks or need to
Awesome bhai

@shriya_saran1109 These types of whales (as well as all other types) are endangered and taken in to aquariums for protection. Aquarians and zoos use the money they earn to pay for the animals health care and food and the staff that help look after the animals. All animals are safer in zoos then out in the wild. They have many prediters and by being the zoo, the prediters can't reach them. Ever thought of that
@stefilein77 stop dumping plastic into the ocean. You are killing the natural environment.
Bro he almost the size of that damn whale 😂
@shriya_saran1109 useless SJW
BELUGA WHALE!!! 💙💙💙💙 @little_river97 @sydney_merkz
Leave it to @therock to be arm wrestling a beluga whale...lol... Who won bro???
aww
@fers_world so on your profile you have a picture of your cat, yes? I too have a cat, zues, and I love him more than anything. But guess what? Your pet is the result of captured felines who were breed to make a suitable housepet. Why would you keep a cat against it's will at your house? Why couldnt you just watch a documentary about felines? Once again, hypocrite.
Same hair dresser!!
Come on, #emptythetanks Rock.
Lmao
@ethically_elizabeth so, that's definitely a salt water mammal, they don't use chlorine, they use salt...
Looks tasty👌🏻
SJWs coming out in droves now. Lol. Funny.
Wow so cute like rock

It’s awesome but so creepy at the same time!

Look its Maui making a deal with more ocean animals! #yourewelcome #demigod
Sweet😍
My heart is full with the way you have taken on zoos and aquariums and learning what good they are doing for land and sea animals. With you bringing your family to places like this it allows them to be a voice of education that only see one side of things. Thank you and blessings to you and the family. In my eyes you are like Betty White 💗 education allows knowledge to spread, ignorance allows us to fall into a void one can not come out of.
😂 @eazymoney216
❤❤
incredible 😃
@maddihenderson so true. They don't understand what zoos and aquariams are. They are a place for the animals to be protected
Pathetic 🖕
Absolutely awesome!
@therock for marine mammals of this size, captivity in aquarium tanks is akin to a human living in a bathtub it’s entire life. Please boycott aquariums. @steveo #seaworldsucks #aquariumssuck

The idiocy and irony of this post is staggering. Let this muthafucka free...
Sad to see these in captivity tho :/

I'm speaking from Bangladesh.  Our students held a protest for ensuring Better Road safety, as two school students were killed by a bus in the capital.... They protest was peaceful.But  our school going students were beaten, by the Police & the CHATRO LEAGUE.... .
Today, All the private Universities of our capital were under attacked. Several Versity Students are severely injured. So many of them are Hospitalized. .
Still this oppression is running. The residence of students are being raid & students are being arrested.... Who just held a protest for ensuring Road safety.

Our Media is under pressure. Some of the finest are under arreast. In this type of situation, we need your Attention towards us,...your awareness to these suffering of us & your help to save our brothers & sisters from this.

Beautiful.x

This is one of the saddest images I have ever seen. This poor whale is locked up. A prisoner. Kept in condiment and completely unnatural environments simply so vapid humans can take a picture with them to post to social media. If you had any care/respect/appreciation for this amazing sentient being, you would be BOYCOTTING this sick captive industry. Come on @therock  Wake up. No one thinks this is cool anymore #boycottcaptivity #captivitykills

I love your photos and am glad you got to spend such a beautiful day with your family learning about God's amazing creatures.
All the people bashing the rock for posing with the animal, first of all I get it. They belong in the wild. But that being said how many of you help homeless people unconditionally because they didn’t ask to be homeless and love with nothing, but most do t give a shit. Some of these animals are better off in captivity because of injuries or they’ve been in captivity since they were babies and wouldn’t survive in the wild. If you care so much look into the facts of why they are in there also help people first
I hope you and the family had a great time and learned a lot! That is a great aquarium!
👏👏👏
👏👏👏
Omg! Yes of course most agree about captivity, but stop coming down on everything! I love animals too, but dont condemn me if i take my child to see them if they are at an aquarium
@stefilein77 he didn't put them there.... calm down.
Rocky so cool😎😍
What will Kevin Hart say? Lol
@shriya_saran1109 kys lol do something about this then haha! Oh yeah u cant 🙇🏿‍♂️🤩🤩

Genuinely thought the rock was punching a dolphin

How fun to have this experience...be this close to nature.  Might be in left field but my TV gets 2 channels (no gripes) & I get the Flipper show...yep I love it.
Great pic @therock keep up the great work 👍👍💪💪💪💪
@zalfakhayat yuyyyy😍😍💪🏼💪🏼
@dragoonace and I realize there are some good things zoos do but my point is that they do bad things too. We can help animals without practices that cause unnecessary captivity. We need to show zoos that those practices are not ok and we will only give them money when they stop breeding and capturing. That’s how the world gets better. We vote every time we spend money. It’s sounds like we both at least agree that capturing and breeding is bad but you just think it’s a necessary evil. I’m telling you it’s not, zoos and aquariums can transition away from breeding and capturing...many already are...and it’s all because activists have protested those practices and are supporting sanctuaries, rescues, and conservation efforts while avoiding giving money that goes to capturing and breeding. We vote every time we spend money and the companies will adapt and change only if we show them they need to.
anybody else think that the whale has abs? just me ok
Nicce
Such a beautiful creature
Beluga whales are awesome. And so are you for spreading that message. Don’t listen to activists. They have agendas but don’t really care for animals. @georgiaaquarium keep up the good work on behalf of sea life.
Amigo genio the rock...sos lo mas loco claro k me voy a matar a escribir si no lo vas a leer no cierto jaja igual genio capo total.
You seem to recognize their beauty and intelligence @therock. Please don’t promote their captivity. We need to move away from this dated circus like enslavement of marine mammals. You have a large following which may not be informed on how bad their lives are. If Blackfish taught us anything, it’s that Dolphins and Whales belong in the ocean.
@missy_jski stop dumping plastic into the ocean!
@shriya_saran1109 if humans would stop hunting them we could stop the captivity. But so many are becoming extint. And their own enviroment has become toxic for them to live in. Sad but the few in captivity have a better chance of survival
Freewilly
Pretty disappointing man. I admire so much about you, but please do some research about how much these animals suffer in captivity.
@traceging60  finally someone that makes the rock look a normal size 😂😂😂
@408.destiiny That’s not what is going on in this picture.

My favorite animal because God make create animals❤️
@408.destiiny Unfortunately Georgia Aquarium is specifically known for hiring Russian companies to catch baby belugas in northern Russian waters because there’s no regulations. Many die upon capture, captivity and transport. Georgia Aquarium was actually denied permits for 13 belugas about 2 years ago, but after they’d already hired a Russian company to capture some babies. They were confident they’d get the permits. When they didn’t, the belugas were unable to be sold elsewhere and most died in captivity. There’s an entire documentary on Netflix about the beluga industry and their capture in Russian waters where there are no regulations. This is the source of beluga trade.

Not cool. Animals are not entertainment and should not live in captivity. Disappointing @therock
Anche The Rock è tuo fan @daniel.cuello! 👀

Awesome!!! 💙❤️❤️💙💙❤️💙❤️❤️
@shriya_saran1109 oh shut up. He didn't put them there he's just having a good time.
Wow, I am not sure if that thing is real or a statue! Crazy!!
Seriously people get a life, his just any other family man, a dad having quality time taking his kid/s to see the animals.it may or may not mean his for animal captivity. Ever thought some of this animal will not survive in the wild anymore. Especially the ones that was born and raised in captivity? Im against animal capacity but used your time to argue about wild whales. Dolphone and etc being hunted in the wild. Instead of criticizing the rock spending time with his family. Like it or not some of this organization actually are the ones rescuing sick animals then releasing them back to the wild.
@therock  you know what's super funny, this photo looks like your punching him in the chest, and then the photo with this seal it looks like you have a sword to his neck.... you animal hater 😂😂 JK lol that place looks Awesome.
How UNcool! #animalabuse #emptythetanks UNFOLLOW @therock
💪❤🐋
Aww😍❤️
Nice
Hey, DJ - I've been a fan since probably '98, and this is by far my favorite picture of you.  You look completely and genuinely awed and full of joy.
Come on Rock with the following you have my brother wouldn’t you want to use it to have these very intelligent animals free.My self I’ve been in a cell with no freedom and it is the loneliest and depressive state anyone can be in so I feel so much hurt for that poor animal use your fame to help get them to their home and families
U r so hot omg
@jerseypepper82 I know that, but I never said anything about the beluga whales being rescued. I would never say that about animals that were captured from their homes
@planetearth.andrew this picture dude lmao

Why?!!! Dont suport captivity @therock
You are AWESOME  TRULY BLESSED
Why don’t you talk about The plight of animals in captivity?

Please ignore the morons that are berating your choice of picts.  They do not understand the meaning of animal conservation. Most of their profiles show they are mega-carbon consumers and cause more problems with their consumption than they do by spouting of PETA driven rhetoric.

Bye bye! Unfollowing! @gal_gadot Wonder Woman would call that slavery!
Thank you for wearing cargo shorts. If The Rock wears them, no one is allowed to make fun of me for still rocking mine 😎
Woah❤😘
@408.destiiny Taking animals from the wild does nothing to promote conservation of them in the wild. It hurts their population and makes them more vulnerable to extinction.
@oscarrovati2
It would be better if Kevin Hart’s face was on this whale 😂👍🏻 @therock

So sad and disappointed that you @therock are supporting captivity. “Staggering intelligence” should not be imprisoned in a concrete tank, starved and forced to do stupid tricks for humans.  You could use this as an educational opportunity to learn about how cruel and inhumane this is and teach yourself and your millions of fans. 😔💔 #theyshouldbewildandfree

@gusandrade91 😍😍
@jaydenrufugio people are free to say and think whatever they want, yes. But animals should be free too. The problem here is that people are being selfish. These animals have rights too and they should live in freedom. Ppl can say and think what they want but these zoos and aquariums are not respecting these animals freedom and rights...humans don't own animals..and of course @therock can post whatever the fck he wants...I only care about these animals...
@ethically_elizabeth Jesus, what do you people not understand. I never said it promotes conservation. I simply said that some places rescue, rehabilitate, and release the animals into the wild again.
@rossana_crhis né? +
*_The rock you are a very big fan_*
Aowsom wow👍
Omg this photo made my day %100 ❤️
I am disappointed to see promotion of animal captivity. It should be illegal. Only captivities that should be supported are animal captivities for animals that are unable to survive in the wild on their own.

"@ethically_elizabeth it removes enough that the ppm is negligible.  Again, this isn’t the Japanese dolphinariums like you saw on tv. Why are you ok with dogs being kept alone as pets? There’s a serious disconnect there. 
And I have compassion thanks. Sometimes some animals are taken care of and loved in captivity whereas in the wild they’d be hunted to extinction by poachers and caught in tonnes of plastics. You paint with that broad of a brush and your message becomes hollow. Just FYI."
So cute 😘
@la_croisson Those aren't the only choices. Ban hunting, enforce existing laws, create sanctuaries. Saving a species doesn't require teaching them stupid tricks.

I love belugas. They're so cute
Unfortunately,  people stole those animals freedom
@k1era10 awwww that is the cutes thing ever!!!!💖💖💖😭😭😭
Can't wait to see this movie
Hey Dwayne! Was zur Hölle tust Du da? Du solltest Dir wirklich überlegen was Du jetzt gerade tust ....Du wirst viele Fan's verlieren wenn Du soetwas postest...setze dich mit deinem Namen genau für diese Tiere ein und auch alle anderen die in irgendwelchen Zoo's gefangen gehalten werden....es ist deine Entscheidung!!!!!!
@therock surely you know that what you saw are whales and dolphins that half starved in order to coerce them into doing tricks for VIP guests. The beluga looks as if it is smiling, always. It is not. This intelligent animal was taken from the wild and is essentially kept in solitary confinement. #georgiaaquarium put an end to captivity! And if you are to keep these animals at least stop forcing them to do unnatural tricks for food. Are you a circus? I am not laughing and neither is the beluga.
Auwwww, cute 😍😍😍
@baileygrayvold
@saylawayxo just FYI I ate a steak last night and it was delicious!!!
Someone stole him before that whale goes on rampage
A lot of people having a go at @therock! ask yourself one question would they be safer in the wild with there family being hunted by guess who?.... that's right Us HUMANS there is no animal or mammals Safe while we exist in or out of captivity we are the one's that should be extinct . Not any of them!
哈哈哈哈哈哈
😍😍😍
That feeling when The Rock takes the beluga whale out of the water with just a couple fingers 😂💪
💪gorgeous
@manuchcat that's what I'm saying the time might have started for the selection of these animals to be tamed and selected for domestication... Dogs are really result of wild dogs and wolf's... You can look for that... There are many examples where wild animals like tiger, lion, beer, wolf, reptiles and even fishes live with humans... Are they adapting to live with humans like dogs... Who knows in another 500 years they will be no more wild animals and some new specie will grow to domesticate... People who keep dogs they also do it for pleasure... I give food go many stray dogs and cats daily, but I never tried to capture them in captivity of mine house...

@maddihenderson doesn’t take a genius to know that an animal who belongs in an endless ocean is a prisoner in damn kiddy pool.
Wow
@millyglam 🙄🙄🙄
That is beautiful
@ethically_elizabeth the dog has a home?? As a slave. Dogs should be enjoyed in the wild, or on film. Not enslaved for your personal smug satisfaction.  Taken away from its family. Shame.
There are more animal abuse happening in the homes of those who “foster” or adopt cats, dogs, horses etc. Zoos and aquariums provide positive science research and education. I have no problem with them. I went to seaworld last night and the Killer Whale show was AWESOME!!
And yet we keep them in a cage @therock 😔
@fers_world if people can think and say whatever they want, then let us watch animals in zoos like this. Let @therock post whatever the fuck he wants.
that's a very cute thing 🐋

@brendancaddy staggering intelligence? if it had staggering intelligence it wouldn’t be in an aquatic prison

@therock! These animals are not for our amusement. Please see past the facade and dig deeper.

Animals suffer greatly in confinement. They are often stolen when they were young from their families, hauled around world in unnatural environment, then kept in tanks too small for them. Do you want to captured and confined? And stolen from your families? Why are you supporting animal cruelty! I know you have a heart, please stop advertise animal cruelty to your fans. Please educate them about the truth of aquariums, Seaworld, zoos and circuses. It’s 2018, please help stop these barbaric ancient practices. 🌸🌱🙏🏼

@therock it saddens us to see such a smart and influential man endorsing animal captivity for human entertainment. These animals are stolen from wild in the most horrible of means then subjected to an unnatural life of imprisonment. Why are you using your power and reach to endorse this cruelty??

@therock @nikkohurtado this would far better if you were observing this beautiful creature in its natural environment, there is nothing awesome about this picture, for me it's just disappointing, you have a big audience and this is promoting animal cruelty. #blackfish
Shame on you, you should know better.
@sunipal Beluga are really playful themselves :3 I believe they need to create a connection with them, to take care of them, giving them food, they need to be trusted. I believe they don't make tricks for entertainment, just they learn how to greet humans. I agree tho, a context would have been nice.
Uaauu !!
Dear @therock, please learn more about how these amazing animals are brought to zoos and aquariums, it’s hardly beautiful. They are confined for human entertainment when they should be in the wild or in a sanctuary to not be objects of amusement. You have such reach and influence and I urge you to learn more about this before you endorse animal exploitation. I’m sure @peta would love to help shed light on these issues. Thank you.

@pukhtanish so because he went to an aquarium, he's supporting animal captivity? If that's the case, then you following @therock Instagram means that you are supporting every action he's doing, including "animal captivity". Look at yourself you hypocrite, go back to your vegan world.

"@ethically_elizabeth the water quality is not irrelevant if you’re spreading misinformation. 
What kind of shitty ass Marine biologist would claim that these tanks are chlorinated? I’d rather some of these animals be taken care of in captivity then in the wild to be poached until extinction. 
But chlorinated tanks? You have ZERO credibility. Thanks bye 👋🏿"

Hearts are one
@redden12301 watch a dvd if you want to see them and can’t see them in their natural habitat! An animal shouldn’t exist rather than live because you can’t afford to see them in the wild! Think about what you are saying and watch the cove or blackfish and then tell me if you saving a few pennies is worth it!! 🤦‍♀️

@aliciaweems it’s fine @therock was just right across from your house. #ilovehim
Idk but I think that if the animals didn't like it there they would not eat at all and then they would get aggressive and start killing people cause that's what has happened when few aquariums tried to have great white sharks cause great white sharks need a lot of space and when the aquariums got them they didn't eat at all and then they got aggressive and some of them killed some people and then they died cause they need to be in salt water and they would need a lot of space well all I'm trying to say is I don't think animals should be put in captivity but we can't help what other people do ik some people hate seeing animals in captivity but we can't help it we can't help what other people do its like saying love not hate peace not war but there is still gonna be hate and there is still gonna be war no matter what we can't help that I would love for there to just be peace and love on earth no violence no nothing just peace and love respect a person even for all the bad shit they've done in the past
Wow.  Awesome!  Lucky you!
@r2d9000 how selfish of you to support the original murder of many in order to capture and in prison those who are deemed beautiful enough by the aquarium! These beautiful animals are not rescued they are taken and made to exist not live for stupid and uneducated people! No animal should be anywhere near one of these places. If you wish to see them then do so in their natural habitat! You are correct they cannot now be returned to the wild as their pod is most likely murdered and they wouldn’t cope now but that does not make it right and someone as well known and respected as the Rock should most certainly have nothing to do with this barbaric treatment of animals!
Woww

@maddihenderson watching blackfish doesn’t even cover beluga captivity. Captive beluga calves have an infant mortality rate of 65% isn’t it funny that all the pro-caps tell us to get educated while they selfishly support the demise of thousands of cetaceans smh

@hannan_mir in an aquarium though😢
Please respect these highly intelligent animals by NOT supporting their captivity. Belugas, orca, dolphins and other toothed whales suffer greatly captivity- and even more for wild-caught animals. Please watch Blackfish, Born to be Free, A Fall From Freedom, The Cove and/or Inside the Tanks. And follow @dolphin_project and @emptythetanksworldwide for some great info and calls to action!!

@la_croisson LMAO. Anyone hear this guy? “Grow the fuck up”, really? I’d expect an adult to be educated as to know whales do not shake humans hands unless they have been tamed and trained to do so. By going to a Zoo, you are providing them with the funds to keep these practices. Google “animal sanctuaries vs. Zoo’s”. Look educating yourself before spewing your word vomit could go a long way!
🐬🐋🐬🐋🐬🐋❤️
Ok but why the fuck is a beluga in an aquarium
@chekispr @iamcindy.l All of Georgia Aquarium's belugas were born in captivity. They were not "ripped away from their loved ones and placed in a glass house" Furthermore, I don't think that my thought processes or values are the same as a beluga whale's. Even if you believe that belugas might think the same way you do, it is not okay to make up lies such as "captivity kills" and that the whales are "beaten and abused" to support your opinion.
These creatures should be free in the wild
😍😍😍😍
LOL!!! All these so called animal rights activists calling to free the animals from Zoos and Aquariums YET they have dogs, cats reptiles or birds etc as PETS. Oh how ironic.  I love all the aquariums and zoos; especially @seaworldorlando @seaworldsandiego @seaworldtexas @georgiaaquarium @bronxzoo @zoomiami.
Hahaha 🤣
The rock and roll
@harshulganjawala another one who took this fucking picture the wrong way. Fine. Have it your way. And "educate myself" yeah I know about all that behavior is basically trained but that's not the fucking point. But whatever, bye.
😍😍😍😍
@maddihenderson the only education I need is the fact that these animals are meant to be free and not captive. Period.
@la_croisson *educated yourself
@daltonwbaldwin that's the one we went to for our two year anniversary!!
@CarltonWard
Cuute😍
ANIMAL CAPTIVITY IS CRUEL. Shame on you @therock for promoting this.
😔 these majestic animals belong out of captivity...
@saylawayxo their being supported in a healthy environment with caring keepers.
Nice.  Look how cute. 😁

Thank you for supporting an awesome facility such as Georgia Aquarium! Belugas are the best! ❤🐳
@buddy_eve beluga whale
Aren't they tho???
Seriously disappointed in you. This is  cruel and unnecessary captured from the wild where they swim hundreds of miles. To be torn brutally away from their families to a concrete prison. To be fed dead fish to do tricks for your entrainment!! Please please  Watch the cove watch Blackfish #don'tbuyaticket
That poor whale should be free 😢😡 #animalsarententertainment
Fuck u
I like you, you seem kind, funny, good actor but man ...WHAT ARE YOU DOING ??????? Where is your kindness and your  empathy ?? YOU CAN'T TELL "I don't know" not anymore. CAPTIVITY KILLS. LEAVE  ANIMALS ALONE !
I thought that was Vin Diseil 🤣🤣🤣🤣

Wow @therock  world🌏 best
So cute
"C’mon @therock...
How can you be “in awe” of this beautiful slave?
Would you want to spend your entire life inside one room?"
@saylawayxo the animals are there for protection not for cruelty. Some can't live in the wild due to them being hunted. Surly if a species is dying out then it makes sense for them to be protected in a place like that where they are cared for and have the best of Every thing. People say it's cruel to make them do these poses but yet when it watching dolphins for example in the wild they do exactly  the same thing. People that care for these animals can't win. Of they give them exercise they are cruel and if they don't they are cruel. Before u go of on a rant about Dwayne, read up about the actual places he goes to. He would never support  animal cruelty.  In the UK there's places that keep foxes and badgers, it's not because they are pets or put on show, it's to protect them from morons who think it's a sport to kill them.

They shouldn’t be in an aquarium and is sad that you would ‘promote’ the aquarium and cruelty of these animals that should be set free and not held captive 😞
@maddihenderson If you were held captive in some whore house. Being made to sell yourself and there were people trying to save you and get you home. How would you feel if I said nah! Then the whore house will lose money. The men wouldn't be able to watch her perform. People couldnt make money off her. Leave her there. Animals arent objects. They want to be free just like you would. Dont disconnect yourself. We all want the same.
Fantastic
Shouldn't be in captivity that should be left alone in the wild
perfect

@monicaaguilarp
@pukhtanish First, I'm not a damn paid instructor. I gave you your first bit information. It's up to you whether you choose to still be ignorant or you use the internet for something other than jumping to conclusions. Second, what would you rather rescued animals do?? Be put back into the wild and die a painful death or have the human interaction that they've come to know and love? An animal is considered a rescue when they were and are continuously are unable to function in the wild, either from abandonment, birth defects injury, natural disaster, ect. How selfish of you to want to put that animals life in danger just so you can say it's been "returned to the wild". People like you never care what harm befalls these animals after they are released.
Check them out in the wild.
I love u
@kennedyfd_ We missed @therock by a weekend
@ethically_elizabeth 🤦‍♂️no. It’s not. Just because some places have in humane practices does not mean everyone else does “the Aquarium’s water comes from the city of Atlanta rather than the ocean, salt must be added to it before it is put into any of our saltwater galleries. Before salt is added, the water is de-chlorinated and tested for any possible contaminants”
This is disgusting
They should be free in the Wild this so disappointing 💔
looks like the Beluga, and you are cool.... phist bummping
Wow.. Awesome...
win sir
#CAPTIVITYSUCKS #EMPTYTHETANKS
Vibe down man,  animals should be free
How fun!
Did he just one-inch-punch that whale?! 👊💥
@therock I'm deeply saddened you are not aware of the struggles cetaceans suffer in captivity. You were correct in stating that Belugas are intelligent and that's exactly why they should never be in tanks. I urge you to seek out further education on belugas in the wild and the terrifying captive industry from Caplpture to Tank. Please read about Little Grey and Little White also. Two Beluga whales who will be the freed to an Icelandic ocean sanctuary after a longtime in captivity in China. You can also watch the documentary "Born to be free" it shows the horrifying captive industry in Russia. The conditions and treatment of these whales will be an eye opener for you. China and Russia currently have an agreement to capture an obscene amount of wild Orca and wild Belugas in the next few years. Two wild Orca were taken from the wild just this week. They now live in a wooden crates on a boat, it could be months before they reach their final destination in China. None of this is fun or pretty. Georgia aquarium once attempted to transfer a dozen Beluga that were Russian captured and were thankfully denied. They are no better than the poachers on land. Please, educate yourself, Sir. Sharing photos like this one supports captivity.
@ethically_elizabeth there are zoos in Asia that drug their tigers for tourists to pose with. Tigers in US zoos are not drugs. You can’t pose with one. The cove is not the standard.
Fuck the @georgiaaquarium  they bought those animals and last time I was there they all exhibited signs of being insane. #emptythetanks
If you really loved this animal you wouldn’t be there promoting the cruelty of these places.
They should be Free and Not in Aquariums.💔 #freethetanks
Looks cool
Covek usao u #Delfinariju 😂🐬🐬
@maddihenderson stfu and educate yourself before you assume some of us have no idea how to do cetacean research
"@ethically_elizabeth “The water at Georgia Aquarium operates on a closed loop system, meaning that the water in each habitat is filtered, treated, and then returned to the same habitat where it was previously. No two habitats at the Aquarium are connected in this system. “

Or maybe you have a better source? Or is it just that documentary you saw?"

@shriya_saran1109 your idiot. Please stop posting this trash. There are animals that actually need help, and your wasting your time on Instagram telling a celebrity they are supporting captivity of animals. Seriously find something that is productive and actually helps animals.
You the boss .... Love your style @therock
@therock  why couldn’t we do this when we filmed Wake Up Call... I been dying to meet a Beluga 🐳 for years 😂😂
In the ocean where it will get hunted and killed by whalers or floating plastic? Or in captivity safe from predators?
Cool  picture
Beautiful creature!

@james_buckler blimeyyyyyy 🐋
@therock he making you look small!! Amazing.
Dear the Rock, I am a very big fan of yours. However, promoting animal captivity on such a large scale is toxic and only brings these aquariums more money to continue to kidnap these animals from their homes and use them for entertainment. I understand that you may think that the post is all in good fun, but with your platform, please think twice about the message you are sending. I am asking you to PLEASE REMOVE these posts.
The cove and black fish are not indicative of all aquarium habitats. That’s like saying anyone that has a dog as a pet is a monster because some people eat dogs.

You see, profane language seldom proves a point..so please explain how different the Georgia Aquarium is from the other places🙏
@kriskunnen @katrienulenaers @kaat_jacobs @glenn.sieborgs  Bailey!!!

@g_ali_priv you are not suppose to save animals by putting them in prison.  You are suppose to put the hunters in prison. You see what's wrong? We have a world leader that thinks trophy hunting is okey, we destroy our oceans by eating fish and going on cruise ships. Putting animals in aquariums to save them is to start at the wrong end. - also I never said it was okey that humans bred cats for their own gaining, I just stated facts that they are domesticated animals that are not suppose to be in the wild. They actually fo more harm than good in the wild because they don't belong there. So you can't compare a wild animal with a cat. There is no logic or reason in that. Also no, I'm not from Iceland. And my name is nowhere near Icelandic neither.

@therock  did you have fb account. Because it says that you"ll give a car/moner to them who share your status about jumanji or something... it is already sprea out
@shriya_saran1109 I hope this can be an educational moment to look into the cruelty of captive whales. @therock Please look into  @whalesanctuaryproject for more information about humane whale captivity. The more you learn about it, the more you realize that all of this is terribly wrong and that there are solutions to save these beautiful creatures.

You should not support animals captivity for money it s shameful to keep such amazing creatures who surf the whole planet in aquariums for human entertainment

hey @therock you are a great guy. Please help us remove these animals from captivity. They don't belong there. They are neither playthings nor friends of human beings. The Earth is theirs as muh as ours. Please let them be as free as you are.
@streetartglobe oof

@jotacasteleiro o vamos =_=
@usrfd1212 im not even vegan lollllll im just against keeping intelligent animals in captivity for our pleasure ;) that need the ocean
@storiesofbina now would you leave those 5 puffins in the wild, endangered and if they die, no turning back, or have them in a place that even though they suffer, they are the great survivors and can expand their population further and not worry about extinction it’s pretty simple
Aw #Twins 😍😂🤙🏻

For Christ sake, let the man enjoy his time with his family at the AQUARIUM. Not everyone feels the same as you tree-hugging nut bags....
@saylawayxo it's probably a sanctuary for injured and sick animals where they set them free after they're better. They also help them reproduce considering they're endangered. You're response is so thoughtless really, does the animal look like it's starving and tortured? No it doesn't, you're just another fool who's out looking for attention, I hope you don't wear makup lipstick is made from whale blubber...

@storiesofbina oof rekt, I’ve been called young, it’s not like there’s 11 year olds in college or anything so age doesn’t really matter, but I understand what your saying but before that was animal cruelty and it was completely supported because why would cats want to help us with agriculture then, we were forcing them to if that’s what you are supporting, and yes we do need to have to take care of animals of the wild now cuz we are just realizing we are killing them, the albino rhino for example, gone forever because they were hunted to extinction and if we were a little bit earlier, we could have saved them
It a whale not a dolphin

Yeah shouldn’t be in an aquarium though ! Too beautiful and intelligent to swim around in a concrete bowl 😢
@shelbyskates1999 i completely agree, in fact it was just announced today that 2 new orcas were just captured from the wild by russia. and that is where this kind of activism is needed. if america were to stop their businesses just to encourage these countries to stop, would it really do anything? would they really stop? people in other countries will still want to go to aquariums and zoos no matter what, and shutting places like this down would only lose money, jobs, and educational experiences for America and have no effect on these countries whatsoever.
@la_croisson oh wow! Please re read my comments. I would never speak to a stranger the way you spoke to me. I guess insulting is easier than arguing. Have a nice day :)
Quisiera saber si es verdad los concursos de facebook ???
@matthewjake too much perfection in one photo..
@g_ali_priv them being born in captivity doesn't justify it. If you know anything about these animals you know what a depressing life they live there.
No;-(
Yes, far too intelligent to be  living its life imprisoned in an aquarium for human amusement. 😔

@g_ali_priv 2. No cats were not bread to be cute. They were bred long before we cared about such things because they were useful in agriculture. 3. We don't have to take care of wild animals we have to stop fucking up nature. 4 by my answers you know you're wrong. But by you're answers I take it you are very young and don't know better.

@maddihenderson I agree that places like this are valuable for educational purposes. What a lot of people don’t realize, though, is that both SeaWorld AND the Georgia Aquarium have sent financial support as well as trainers to Russia and China to help them establish their wild-capture programs. This is wrong.

@therock do you even realize that your promoting animal cruelty? Good for you man your such a great guy promoting to keep animals in cages for mere entertainment. Make better choices know the truth and dont promote this shit. You look like a piece of crap
@la_croisson That's why you never find me at a zoo. Your comment makes no sense at all. The fact that you use 'normal' as revering to posing with a wild animal tells me you've got it all backwards and don't understand anything about why we don't condoned this.
@3featherpants
@buddhatarian real aquariums do more for conservation than any other organizations world wide. Spend a day with the scientists at an aquarium and get an education about why they do what they do. I assure it’s not for profit. Real aquariums are non-profit and money goes to helping not hurting animals. Aquariums are no sea world.
Que lindooooooo

@jonas.bennington Que fofo 😍😍
@sarajo03 wow! It’s far out of the water!!

Funny how all these people are trying to put the Rock down for going to the aquarium, if you look thru their pictures you will notice that most of are holding dogs and cats captive in their houses, not to mention the leather shoes, boots, and handbags the have. Wonder where they got those. So in other words shut up.

@maddihenderson Russia is currently capturing orcas, beluga whales, and dolphins from the wild because, “America’s success in this industry inspired us to do so.” I agree that the animals in captivity now need to be cared for and cannot be returned to the wild, but people don’t realize that supporting this industry here, as it is, is fueling this industry in countries where animal rights laws are far less developed and where the animals aren’t cared for. Encouraging the breeding and training of whales here fuels the capture of whales in countries like  Russia. This is happening NOW and it needs to be stopped.

Ahh come on rock say no to these animals being in captivity!
This is so sad- a poor captive sentient being stolen from his family and forced to perform for people who have no problem with animal captivity and abuse.  Shame on you,  I used to love your movies

Beutiful cute
I think I see a resemblance 😄
Aww cute
Dwayne! Don’t punch that animal! It has no nose and cannot smell what you are cooking.
Wow.. not cool at all.. no longer a fan of u.. thought you knew better 😞😖
If @therock can rock cargo shorts, then so can I.
To get that close to that beauty must have been amazing.
Olha que golfinho lindo @princesa_kesia
Just like you handsome, big n strong yet soft hearted inside❤️🙏
@susan_swanay
There are better ways to see these animals. Whale watching is a great way to support conservation efforts in areas where whales live. I went whale watching in Victoria, Canada and in Juneau, Alaska. Both whale watching companies work with organizations such as WWO and Whale Research Center to protect these animals in the wild. Do NOT support captivity!

I bet you that whale is saying to himself or herself with this guy stop flexing his muscles in every movie he makes and everywhere he goes lol!!
Beluga whales are amazing. It must have been a great experience!
A beluga whale brought me my engagement ring 💍
Posting about ocean wildlife in captivity. Disgusting.🚫 @therock
@garrettcandau @remy.weiss @bretthoskins25 smh the rock wears cargos
@andria_co have you worked at an aquarium? It is nothing like what you are saying. You watch a couple of shows and read a few pointed articles and now you are going to educate the world. You are out of touch
Скала,дай денег. Мы очень нуждаемся
@mikefafara does kinda look like me tho
💖💖💖
@therock Looks like a human light weigh... That's incredible man
@shelbyskates1999 i definitely do see both sides, and for awhile i saw these documentaries and started commenting these things that people are right now and making myself think i was making a difference. but people don’t know the behind the scenes... these animals pasts in the wild and how healthy they were, whether or not they were bread in captivity or taken from the wild, who is caring for them, etc. every situation is different and it’s illegal to take animals from the wild now so all people can do for now is take care of the ones who were already stolen from the wild. it’s not supporting a group who is harming wild animals, they aren’t able to take them from the wild anymore and all they are doing at this pint is trying to give them the best care possible ....
@flackeezy I do read and sometimes people get depressed from work and die let's stop working....fuck off

Those creatures deserve to be in the ocean.  NOT kept in cages for our entertainment!  You need to do your research on this sort of thing and realize what you are promoting!  You just lost me as a fan!!!’ Shame on you!!!!
Aquariums are bad for dolphins tho :( they don't have enough living space
The rock with armoo
@patiisfr hahahahahahhahah
Lmao @ cargo shorts
Awesome
😍😍😍😍😍❤️
Awww I love the pic its awesome
Soo beautiful
❤💙
@r2d9000 it's about how the place is it's about the space they live in :D they can't decide where they go in the ocean they can. It also decreases their lifespan.
👌👌👌
💪💪💪💪
Sick
I admire you as an actor. I love your movies. But this photo breaks my heart. This angel of the ocean should live in freedom.💙🐋🐬💙 He/she was not born to entertain us. #borntobefree #captivitykills
So nice
Oh I love you, but don’t encourage this beautiful creature being stuck in a bathtub for life.
Captive beluga programs are cruel. Captive belugas have a shorter lifespan in captivity than their wild counterparts. What parks like SeaWorld don’t tell you is that these intelligent animals often require antidepressants and antipsychotic medication when in captivity. I’ve got friends who’ve quit their jobs working with dolphins and whales in captivity because of how cruel the captive industry is. Please, do some research on your own and don’t support this industry. Best of luck to you.
@therock I’m a big fan! However I really think you should be advocating for these amazing wild animals to be back in the wild and not in captivity. Let’s see a post helping to increase that awareness.
@usrfd1212 vegan is about respecting animals lmao phones don't effect animals directly :)
Just watched moana 😁🤪
#setthemfree
Which one are you?
@saylawayxo ok bye then
Come on Duane really??? These animals need to be free or in a sanctuary not in a concrete pool!!! PLEASE PLEASE be an advocate for their freedom not their TORTURE  u have a HUGE voice please use it to HELP THEM !!!!! Big fan but won’t be if u make a movie with any marine animal
💔😆
Que belleza

That’s so cute
🖤
@jessicalong15 just when I thought I couldn’t love him more
Oh the tree huggers are triggered 🙄 as usual they won’t do anything to help the animals, they are just going to be triggered on instagram 😂🤦🏼‍♂️
@saylawayxo omg he’s going to miss u so much
@cara226 the rock and a beluga whale. What more do you need? 😂
Unfollowing
@popski625 that’s definitely not true. We bred cats and dogs to be domesticated and they are no longer able to care for themselves so we have to. Whales are torn from their home and family in the wild and forced to live in an enclosure that is barely big enough for them to turn around. And if you think pets are for entertainment, I hope you never get a fucking pet 🤦🏽‍♀️
@maddihenderson It’s not just Blackfish. I’m against captivity and I HATE Blackfish because of how biased the film is. There’s even more to captivity than what Blackfish shows, though. I hope you have it in your heart to see things from both sides of the debate.
@vivi_darling @thecarolynn
@maddihenderson the fact is, they dont have enough living space just like great whites can't be kept in captivity a dolphin or whale shouldn't either they need the ocean so they can go and do whatever they want whenever they want.
Come on, man.....this is your platform for doing good.......
Omg!! Amazing,  a dolphin white 😍😍😘😘 congratulations

@therock Why are you so far from the edge? It's okay, he's your friend. He won't bite.  Get in closer. Or can't you swim? Lol
@michiskippi but this is not a sanctuary where wild animals live safe and protected.. this kind of places are totally unnatural to them. Small enclosures, most of the time these highly social animals have none of their species, and on top of that.. forced to perform silly tricks? How is this necessary? I respect your opinion, but I have to disagree. Accepting the problem is not a solution and we have to fight for what's right.
Destiny?

"Like you said, he's a very clever animal, aware of his situation, of being captive and having to do unatural tricks to be feed.
Because of the bassin he can't speak, ever cause the wall send back his sonnar right to his ears like a massive echo.
You should not support those aquariums.
They kill whole famillies to have the good looking one. Look at Taiji bay how parks and aquariums choose their dolphins and what happen for the unchossen ones..."
@jasonbolalek I know that. And I know the different, I’m not an idiot. And I know that their habitat is not disappearing, I never said that their habitat is disappearing. I said some animals that are in zoos habitats are disappearing
Oh no baby what is you doingggggggggggggggggg

@derekmarkson heartless!
Sick bro!
@therock please don’t support this..
You have a choice to be a performer. These whales do not. Whales don't belong in tanks, if you truly are in awe, then respect them and see them in the wild.
😍😍😍😍
Free them!!!!!!! Why would you support aquariums by visiting this hell hole 😳 disappointed and shocked to see this by someone so influential
Asuu que hermoso..
"Producers: Ok so we are going to make a remake of free Willy 
@therock : ""I already freed Willy""

Producers: Ok we're going to make a new movie called Get Willy Back"""
Quite awesome.
@usrfd1212 animals do get depressed and die from it sometimes smh read a fucking book.
Uauuuuuu 👏👏
@andria_co let’s be real, people aren’t gonna stop polluting the ocean, we may try to make a change but there will always be someone, and having a NONPROFIT organization making an effort to save ocean life, its for a good cause and mainstream media and people who are too blind to do some actual research that this specific aquarium doing.
Your the man!!
How could you not be
The creatures are awesome love seeing them
You are right, these whales are beautiful, peaceful, beings... when they are ripped from their homes and families in the wild to be held in captivity for human entertainment. I have always though highly of you and I am very disappointed to see this. This magical creature suffers daily. He is highly intelligent so he is constantly bored and misses his family and home. This is sad not cute. I hope you will show your enormous fan base that this is not acceptable. You have a lot of influence @therock, use it wisely.

@alibgt_ super 😂😂😂
@gmrg_
@usrfd1212 also, as you are talking about my choices.. I am sure you can find many things that I do wrong, but guess what! I try to improve every single day, because I know that my choices have an impact. And not eating or wearing animals is the easiest. Even easier is not to support cruelty and captivity. Two wrongs don't make a right. And if once our choices contributed to the problem, is our duty to do our best to change that.
👎 a beautiful creature that belongs to the SEA...not to the cruel tank of the #GeorgiaAquarium
@tinroof98 I'll shoot for this for your next big birthday 😍
Lot of folks want them freed !
"Everyone is talking about these creatures in captivity.. truth is, they are safer there right now than in the ocean.. check out the Lake Okeechobee disaster going on right now. Thousands of fish, manatee, dolphins, turtles, etc all washing up dead. 😥

So wonderful picture 👌🏻🌷🌹🌻🌷
@andria_co also you. I don't care if you support anti-animal cruelty or wwhatever but mistaking a picture as someone supporting animal cruelty is just a shit move and immature. You grow the fuck up too. You make choices and you make mistakes but doesn't mean you can be an asshole.
Please don't support this captivity. They suffer in these pools and live a highly artificial existence. Watch #blackfish #TheCove and follow @coveguardians on Twitter 🐬💔😪🐬💔😪🐬💔😪

@usrfd1212 not having animals performing silly acts so we can take "great pictures" makes me out of touch? This no sanctuary! Most aquarium animals were not saved, they were stolen from the sea or breeded in one! I am being realistic by realising that all these peope care for,  is their profit!
Nice 👍🏼
Disgusting!
Not very cool :(
Aaaaw, so sweet.
@suzansvdw i don't know what's a "normal behavior" for a beluga but if you came here just to bitch at someone posting pictures of them having fun at a zoo like a normal person and mistaking it as supporting the aquarium's clandestine activities then YOU get the fuck out of here and out of the internet entirely.

@suzansvdw also if you were at a zoo and you posted a picture of yourself with a zebra in it and people know zebras are part of the nearly-extinct animals then they'll bitch at you like they bitch at the Rock for acting like a normal zoo visitor. Grow the fuck up.
You’re a little steroid headed bitch abusing animals is not a good look
@kadelee09 Brennen was so excited when I showed him this picture this morning. He kept saying “Beluga” 😂

Pertenecé al mar ahueonao
@mk_temirkulov that’s not even remotely true. They kidnapped those animals belugas from their families in the wild to market for entertainment for humans when the aquarium was struggling. They were offered grant money if they could bring in more people. So suddenly they have belugas. You do the math. There is no conservation going on there.

Empty the tanks! This is cruel and completely unnecessary. Please don‘t support animal prisons.
OMG Calm the fuck down people. #GeorgiaAquarium has one of the best conservation programs. These animals get rehabilitation, care, support, correct nutrition to regain their health, they get taken care of and in some cases where it’s possible they get released back into the wild. Just shut up already.
Que hermosa esa beluga.... y su amigo!
@la_croisson Interacting? Are you implying that this is normal behaviour for a beluga? Get the f* out of here.
@stefilein77 you are making a fool of yourself.... educate and see the great medical advances that these animals have provided. It's not all bad and inhumane

@usrfd1212 apparently some people do :)❤️☺️😘
Dude, I love you for so many reasons. But after this post I find myself disappointed. Please get some info regarding the capture and training and then lifestyle of these animals. Then you can make your own honest decisions about how you feel regarding this type of captivity. For me, it breaks my heart and I cannot stand for it. Whales and dolphins are so smart, imagine if you were in their place experiencing a similar life. It would break my mind body and soul to be trapped like them. #family #belugawhale #trapped #animalcrueltyawareness #blackfish #earthlings #veganfortheanimals #tanksbutnotanks #boycottseaworld #freelolita @peta

So sweet Sir
Our marine life needs people like you to protect them, but in a pool? We need to love and protect these beautiful creatures in the wild!!

@therock no no no 😳😳😳 #captivitykills. Really disappointed to see this.
Omg! Belugas are my favorite! They’re so soft and sweet. Honestly, they’re super underrated and it’s sad.
@therock Not cool!! Please, become a voice 📣 for the animals instead! 🐬🐘🐻🦏🦁🐒🐎🐮🐖🐧 None of them deserve to live in captivity and be used by humans for profit. 💓💗💓💗💓

Awwww that is an amazing animal. And that is so sweet.
@britstagram4
@solicitous_e he is aging so well.
@bradleyabi how about the advances to medical intelligence and insights that has been provided by aquariums and these animals? Guess we should remove it all and let thousands of people die.
❤❤❤❤
@da_skara made me lol
@therock . I love you rock 😍❤❤
💪🏾💪🏾💯💯
Looks like you made a new friend
Free them Rock. They shouldn’t be in those concrete prisons
@therock que te pasa? Apoyando a los Acuarios? Shame on you, you think that whale is happy trapped in that jacuzzi ??!!
Never thought I would want to be a beluga whale, but Dwayne Johnson makes me want all@kinds of things.
Nice
Nice
@saylawayxo so we should do anything that might affect animals natural existence......we will be dead in less than 15 years. Also take a real close look at all you do and wear and consume.....guess what if your honest you will see in some way you are part of the inhuman process
You finally met your match @digitally.xtreme #digitally.xtreme

Asshole, you should not support animal cruelty. It would be great if they put you inside a cage, so we dont have to see you acting like shit!
Save the dolphins
@lowwpezz
I thought you’re better than this! #fuckcaptivity
@shriya_saran1109 do you have any clue the advances in medical science alone that has come from these aquariums and animals.....it is staggering the number of lives saved. How about looking at a bigger picture rather than bashing people
@saylawayxo @therock is amazing
@therock can even make cargo shorts look cool again!
That should live in the free. Dont support animal cruelty

Cruel
Dude the dolphin isn’t wet
@bringinguplexiandnavy
So cruel
please no adv in cavour of animals kept in captivity
I encourage you and anyone seeing this to please consider what it's like for these animals living in this kind of environment. A few moment of entertainment for you can mean a lifetime of misery for them... Please watch 'Blackfish' online to get an idea of what it's like to be one of theae beautiful sea creatures confined to small pools & tanks in captivity, when really they should be in the ocean with their families... whether they were bred into this life of captivity or kidnapped, both are unnecessary. When we stop paying to exploit them, stop going to places like Sea world, stop paying to swim with them or see them do tricks, stop paying for their use in entertainment, then these places will stop exploiting them. It's really that simple, if we want them animals like these to be free then we must show it with our actions. Please think twice when you see a picture like this, there's always a story behind it... ❤ thanks for listening if you got this far x
@rodolfo.brunelli coitada do anjinho 😂😂😂
😍
@therock - Real shame you’re promoting this crap. One of the major holiday operators in the UK have recently stopped promoting holidays to Seaworld and the like. Too similar I’m afraid.
I am disappointed, why would you promote such animal cruelty!! You should be using your platform to educate people and to stop these beautiful creatures becoming captive entertainment!!! 😭
😞😢

Your face is so pure 😊
@therock you were my favorite big bald sexy beast until you decided to support whales in captivity. Really disappointed and feel let down that a guy I looked up to made this decision. Not cool at all big man.
Yah im sure it is having s bladt in that small ass pool doing tricks for your enjoyment. Lol.

Really @therock ??!!! This belugas were taken from the wild. Why are you celebrating this? Bad example for so many people specially children that follow you.
My research on Belugas is in the process of finally being published - I had the honor or studying them for years, and they are amazingly intelligent and fascinating whales! Thank you so much for posting this, it means so much to Beluga awareness !! ❤️✌🏼

@therock I love you but disappointed.  They are amazing and intelligent beings that belong in the wild.  Not confined to a tank for our entertainment.
Make a movie with him
Sad to see you support animals in captivity - when you have such a big beautiful voice to empower young people. Animals in captivity is wrong and torture. Please rethink this! #emptythetanks #endanimalcruelty @therock
@choda19a
They have always fascinated me!
Why does @therock support and promote this kind of slavery?  Shameful. 🤬
Wow🐋
@mrstemurph
@riptide42 ??? How so👀

Go bro!
@therock please re-think this post. Supporting intelligent aninals in captivity, just for our entertainment and so-called "education" is immoral and unethical!! You are blessed to have a voice bigger than theirs and ours, so please use it to do good!!
what a shame
This is not cool at all @therock . I'm so sad you are promoting animal captivity. This little creatures belongs to ocean 💔😢

Intelligent animals cruelly imprisoned for our entertainment. @therock educate yourself.
@ochocinco 👀
Poor thing should be in the wild not some tank!!
@dizzylizzie1959 or maybe if we stop destroying their habitat, stop polluting the ocean and stop eating fish? Keeping them prisoners for our profit should not be the only way to survive!
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Wow rock's
Nice
"What are you doing? I had you as a caring and informed guy, but supporting the cruel and abusive practice of holding these creatures captive is far from that.
I hope this was a PR mistake and you’d rather be a cure than part of the problem."
On this picture definitely @therock  is the co star ✌
@maddihenderson you need to get yourself educated. You are in ignorant. Please open your eyes and change in order for this world to be a better places for all of us including those innocent animals
#emptythetanks

@_rocco__  babe look a beluga!! 🐳
Beautifully georgeous
Yall look like old friends reunited
Maybe you should have a little look into how these whales/dolphins are captured. Georgia Aquarium were involved with Russia to capture these creatures and put them into captivity. It’s cruel and unnecessary to keep them like this, purely for the Aquariums monetary gain.  https://www.ajc.com/news/aquarium-listed-among-worst-tanks-for-dolphins-and-whales-north-america/E6nNmj17ENfJ5m2GOHfPBN/amp.html

Its sad to see @therock supporting obvious animal abuse. I had assumed you would know better.
These animals are held in bath tubs when they are meant to swim for hundreds of miles. They get sick and die early , they suffer from severe psychological damage and neurotic behavior as time goes on

No. Please don't work with animal abuse. Please don't show people that taking helpless animals from the wild and then putting them in a small cage for our amusement is okay. Please don't do this. I'm heartbroken. I love your acting skills 😔 watch #thecove and #blackfish so you can see the cruelty to how your new "co-worker" was found. Please don't do it.

Good one.
Two wild orcas have been just captured in Russia couple of days ago. They have quota for 13 orcas and more than 200 belugas! Captivity fuels wild captures. Did you know Georgia Aquarium tried to import 18 wild caught beluga whales, but the court stopped them because of the brutality that takes place during capture in Russia? That didn’t save those 18 belugas, because they were already captured for Georgia aquarium, who paid for them. Some belugas died awaiting the decision of the court, the remaining were sold to China and Japan. Please educate yourself before you support such cruelty. There is a documentary about those 18 belugas and GA involvement in this crime against the nature. Please watch it - it’s called “Born to be free” and it’s on Netflix. Hope you will be able to see the truth

@alviramurisonswartz yes there is as stated by someone else the Belugas main source of food is dropping lower in the ocean and the belugas can hold their breath long enough to reach said food . So captivity is the only way they will continue to survive.
👍
WHYYY😔😔😔😔
@_taysimone bullshit that the animals are rescues.really nice story but it’s completely bullshit-why don’t you go ahead and release them into the wild now that they are healed??? How will you make a profit unless there are held in captivity you dumbass
Amazing 😁

shocked and disappointed you’d support keeping wild animals in captivity. stolen from the wild and put in small tanks without their families to entertain humans? educate yourself and set a better example for the rest of the world. do better than this.

@therock I know that after reading all these comments and doing a bit of research you will understand the deep pain and suffering caused to animals in captivity.  It’s is never ever, ever okay for us to in-prison creatures and force them to entertain us - no matter how many people claim “they like it”. Being ripped from your family and your ocean home to spend your short life in a tank is repugnant.  Don’t support animal cruelty.

Sad to see you supporting Slavery like this. You will have seen how intelligent these animals are. Do you think it really wants to live in a bathtub, Forced to entertain humans if it wants to eat ?  You are better then this. #Emptythetanks #seaworldslavery
Oh cool!
@reverse_taye I don’t care about money I don’t want to be ruled by paper tbh
@the_big_guy03 we missed him by a week!!!
"true, they are the support of the world in which we live.
complete and wonderful.
pure and happy beings.
even against the conscience of the human being.
every day we are more those who support, defend and try to do our best for a clean ocean to condemn the killing of cetaceans worldwide and eliminate the captivity.
 if the cetaceans, Marine lions, Sharks.... were extinguished the world would be 4 parts of water.
thank world, thank you god thanks to each and every one of the species of cetaceans odontocetos and mysticetes that take care of our sustainability.
from Spain. Thank you"

You are right to love them they are wonderful beings 💙 would you become their ambassador, their voice, and help us to get them out ? Please 🙏 Chloryne in tanks is killing them, among other things.

I miss you mu frendy
@storiesofbina ok ok so, 1. Maybe these animals were born in captivity 2. Cats must have lived a living hell getting breeded to the point to they are now, they were literally forced to fuck to make cute versions of themselves so people would buy them 3. Maybe some of these animals can’t survive in the wild and we have to save them all 4. You are uneducated

It's a dolphin version of George the gorilla
Disappointing
@daisy_cosplay I'm glad to hear they are one of the good ones and to know they are not for profit. I hope all of their animals are rescued and not bought/taken. However, The Rock taking a picture of him shaking hands with a Beluga without giving context and explanation perpetuates the idea of captive creatures for human entertainment and to do tricks. It also begs the question of why close-up human interaction is allowed in the first place and why animals are made to perform such tricks if rehabilitation and animal welfare is their true priority.
@derekmarkson Actually he has 112 million now so I think they made it go up. Lol

I bet most of the people here preaching about animal cruelty have a pet at home such as a cat or dog and they teach them tricks and put them on a leash so they don't run away and get hit by a car though. Stop attacking him for a photo of him admiring a Beluga.
😍😍
@therock this upsets me no end. I thought with you Polynesian heritage, you would value life better than to support animals in captivity.

Telling me what you think about a conversation which didn't involve you, thing is, cos I wasn't "debating" you, I'm not interested in what you think, full stop (obviously!!) 😂#desperate #whotaggedyou #andicarewhy #trolltrash

Oh no 😩 don’t feed the corporate demons that take these beautiful creatures from their habitants and make them live in fish tanks!
@ferraz_gs olha que lindo amor
"Well, this is unexpected. 😒 thought you know better than this. Tell me @therock wouldn’t it be so much cooler to watsch this „beautiful animal with staggering intelligence“ in its natural habitat? Those animals just don’t belong in captivity. They are not supposed to entertain people. It’s just wrong and sad on so many levels. 
Watsch The Cove or Blackfish etc. It’s heartbreaking. 
I am glad there are so many people here who are aware of what is going on behind the scenes of those aquariums. Take care."

I helped in projects that assisted the conservation of our local and world wide wildlife. I released rescued animals. I helped make enrichment to help the keepers give the animals even happier. I took part in rewilding projects and i helped people understand sustainable farming by cooking with insects etc... what the fuck have you done?

@rjtaylor20 just that her spellig might not be as good as someone’s who speaks English as a native language. Therefore you ”pointing out” might seem as rude to some people, especially to bilingual people. Plus I think everyone who read this conversation chain understood it perfectly well that @dyne7 meant ”entertaining” with a slight typo.
Thank you, @therock for supporting accredited zoos & aquariums! We need more celebrities like you supporting the great work we do with & for the animals. Thanks a million! Come see us at Dallas Zoo some day!! ❤️❤️❤️
@laymill770 let’s go downtown and casually “run into” the Rock👌🏼🤷🏼‍♀️
I think he's bigger than the Rock 😘
It’s always better when they wild, Dwayne
Why would you keep such beautiful creatures in such confound spaces? Sad 😢
Hahahah...mai gad😍
You could bench press him bro, light weight! 🤣🤣🤣
Hey Rock, seeing this picture of you has broken my heart, animals do not belong in captivity, these beautiful creatures should be home in the ocean where they belong, please I beg you to watch blackfish and the cove, you will see the cruel truth behind this, I know you have a beautiful heart, I’ve seen you with your dogs, you’d not stand by and watch a dog be used and abused for entertainment so please don’t support these beautiful animals who ARE stolen from their families and used and abused, thank you 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Why visit them in jail? You should be protesting to release ALL animals from their prison!!! @therock
Awwww so cool!!!
cute❤️
You are beautiful
DYK? Belugas are social animals. They communicate using a language of clicks, whistles and clangs 💙 But Belugas in marine parks are denied everything natural and important to them. That are given less space, sometimes no companions and no accessories in the bath tubs they are forced to live in. No one should ever visit marine parks, the animals are never happy and it so frankly visiting a park rife with animals which were subjected to cruelty. Someone as famous an influential as you should understand and know about these things. and DEFINITELY not visit these parks. I’m really ashamed. You should know better, much, much better.
What really annoys me is that you are all commenting about whales being in tanks? What about your fish at home, the parrots you keep, the dogs we all have? The cats? Is it also not against nature to keep all these? Why support one thing yet disagree with another. Yes there are cases where animals are kept in horrific places. There has been documentaries on this. But to comment on one subject for being wrong and then neglect other instances is also wrong. These place when run properly give these animals a chance to survive. Us as the human race has destroyed natural habitats for decades even centuries now for all creatures, and I'm sorry to say in my opinion there is no going back on what we've done we can only try and help in other ways unless you wish to close off all the oceans to try and save what is left.
Soooo cute😌😌😌 she looks like laughing as well 😂 enjoy family time and have fun with those amazing creatures! 😉 👍🤗💯💯
far out I just had a heart attack @kiaraallingham

@becauseimawezome Send me a link then please. Always willing to learn more unlike most people!! Are these places accredited AZA BIAZA zoos and aquariums or places like bali. Because yes there is no denying there are terrible places out there but we are discussing accredited places.

NOT COOL!!!
That ”beautiful animal with staggerin intelligence” shouldn’t be in a tank. I’m sure you could do something about it if you spoke up @therock #emptythetanks  Nontheless you are an awesome guy, keep up the good work! 💪🏽
Yeeey
😍😍😙😙😍
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
@_taysimone Animals are not Property, Objects, Slaves or Machines and what gives us the right to take them out of their home and stick them into a concrete tank
Captivity is wrong how would you like to be held in a tank swimming in circles all day and doing stupid tricks for food they should be free to swim in the ocean were they belong maybe you should do some research on captivity watch the Cove and blackfish you could use your voice against captivity instead of getting stupid photos taken with those poor dolphins !!!
Who wanna know!!!! What the rock is cooking
Awesome post!!
You bring so much happiness every time you smile, a true and lovely guy!

If you are aware of these animals intelligence you would understand how awful it is to keep them caged. Disgusted!
@therock Nooooo this makes me so sad, please don’t support keeping these majestic creatures in captivity. This is everything so many people around the world are fighting against. They belong in the ocean, in their natural habitat, not for us to handle up close and personal. This power of this image will influence & allow people to think this is ok and that we should support companies profiting off their misery and loneliness. As a celebrity you have the power to influence so many with your choices and experiences so I urge you to please not encourage this. They do not enjoy being there and it’s a natural environment for them. This is just so heartbreaking to see. 💔💔🙏🏽😣😔

see! @yourstrulyflavia beluga whales are cute!
I admire u and i think you are one of the best human being and actor but Please do NOT support this kind of things. These animals are really suffering 😢😢😢
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 I love this place 😍
Nice. ..
@greg_burnett
They have to live in the see not in a aquarium. If people stop going to it then the dolphins can live there own life's. Same as zoo animals.
💔💔💔 unfollowed from now ...
❤️
That’s right, they are incredibly intelligent, which is why they shouldn’t be kept in tiny chlorinated tanks, forced to perform tricks for frozen, medicated fish. Please stop promoting animal abuse to your followers. It’s incredibly irresponsible as a role model to so many people around the world. Visit sanctuaries, not animal prisons.
Com bec
@_taysimone So can I assume all the rescue animals like the whale sharks are bieng returned once they are healed.  PLEASE don't say they can't once they have been in captivity.  It's not true its been done time and time again.
Cute 🌙🤘💗😊
Leave them in the wild.
Shame they in captivity for our amusement
The best
Let dolphins free, don’t support captivity

Did you just punch that dolphin in the chest!? Lol

@poppygitsham same reaction I had reading your dumb comment. Let me guess, you had great time there and the animals looked so darn cute and happy? These poor creatures must be rescued from the scary and dangerous nature!! Oh and, did you feel cold today so global warming must be hoax, huh?
@therock , beautiful, intelligent and they shouldn’t be living in a tank. These belong in the ocean my friend. @peta @petauk #BoycottSeaWorld #BoycottAquariums

@indominus16extinction that is the most ignorant reasons for keeping a whale in captivity. Their faces looks like that all the time, even when they are sad🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️

This baby should be in the ocean.
@408.destiiny if they can’t be released to the wild they should be in an open sea sanctuary not performing tricks like slaves in the equivalent of a bathtub. Learn the difference!
He belongs in the wild Rock
Neat
Beautiful yes...but shame they've been kept against there will. All animals should be free. Shame on all aquariums.
@rebekah.gaskin one lucky whale😂
I'm kinda noticing a bit of a resemblance there Rock...... Bulbous domes!!!

Do you’re supporting those animals suffering for an amusement of people like you? Have you read any research on how the captivity impact them? It’s so sad to see another famous person embracing animal cruelty instead of promoting platform of animals rights to be free and happy.. #shamethem #stopanimalcruelty #stopanimalcaptivity

Using a trapped animal for fame ! You use be my hero ! #therockaintcooking
another ra ra rampage thing
All these ignorant comments. Acting like they are doing something to protect these animals, that are being brutally attacked in their natural habitat, by HUMANS. Some were saved and kept for further monitoring. Stop jumping on a Blackfish bandwagon 🤦🏻‍♀️
The beluga is saying “You’re Welcome”..
Protect them. Please don't touch
Rampage: Sea monsters! Haha
So lovely creature 😀

Not cool !!!
His fin is bigger than your arm...got to work on that @therock
He should be freely swimming under the sea tho :(

@chasingtwinies because this picture makes me happy
Amazing pic dude. Love it. 👌
Help your co star go home and get out of prison.
Sooooo cute
So cutee
Please stop promoting animal cruelty @therock  Educate yourself about aquariums and how animals end up in them, how they live vs their natural environment...I can believe you would be this ignorant.
Oh my not another one. Already had to deal with a croc, wolf , and albino gorilla
Not a fan of captive animals 😔😔😔
Check out my art style called wordism!
Y'all have issues. As if you don't go to see these 'animals captives'and have a good time. People are so ready to judge. Like what have you all done to save this animals from captivity...we love you Rock
The ga aquarium really is awesome. They do an incredible amount of work towards helping and preserving wildlife. My wife and I have season passes and really enjoy doing the back stage tours. My wife has also volunteered a couple of years there. Those Beluga’s crack me up playing with each other and occasionally guests.
Lol aye real quick tell that don't don't look an albino Kevin Hart but taller😂😂
They are AMAZING!!!❤️
Such a shame that you're supporting captive cetaceans... Disappointed 🙁😔😢
Wow adorable❣️
@_taysimone when are they being released then after rehab? What’s the release plan? Why do you train them? The jailer always defends the jail...
So happy to have you back in Hotlanta!!!
Next free willy
😍😍😍😍 @nalangucluu
ahh cmon @therock dont support caged wildlife. you are better than that.
Disappointed in you champ, no place for animals in captivity, you shouldn't be promoting this.
@chris_mitchell16 what about the small enclosure there? it's a different thing if they can't be released back into the wild. But if they can, they should be. People are also talking about open sea pens. That's a start. Just because they're animals doesn't mean that we can 'keep' them in these unsuitable conditions. They'll live, sure. But it's not where they are meant to be. The place is too small, the experiences too less when compared to the sea that they are used to. Aquariums that really care should go for other alternatives like open sea pens or where the people have to go to their hang-out place.
Woooooow, This photo is very beautiful
😓💔. This makes me very sad. Not that the Rock will notice but I have to follow now. Whales and dolphins do not belong in aquarium especially for our entertainment. 😢#Emptythetanks #thecove #Blackfish
Oh shit that was a dolphin😀
😡👎🏼
@alinereges quase morri de rir agora 😂😂😂
O gorila branco lá vai ficar na ciumera oo the rock
Disgusting!!!
Si tu les aimes tant que sa tu devrais militer pour qu’ils restent dans leur milieu naturelle
with the gorilla is much stronger 🐸😅
Very very BAD COMMERCIAL! Promoting animal cruelty?! Wild animals living a life in torture !!! They belong TO THE OCEAN 🔥‼️‼️‼️
Sad to see you in this photo!!! There's a huge anti captivity movement that I'd like to encourage you to follow. That is indeed a very intelligent animal, a sentient vulnerable being, which deserves better than a bathtub. #emptythetanks #captivitykills
@cristiano  looking gud buddy ❤️
@therock there are a lot of disappointed fans commenting on this post, please clarify if this whale has been rescued or captured ? No one wants to see a beautiful creature like this locked up in a fish bowl for entertainment. 🙁
😍😍😍😍😍

Do not support the captive wild trade. Do your research from multiple different sources to find out the truth why you are a hypocrite if you say you love animals but still think it is fine if they are forced to be used as entertainment! They are trained by trainer withholding fish and starving them and when they behave good ( what human think is good and not what is actually good ) they get rewarded with food. @dolphin_project #taijidolphinslaughter #freethecages #emptythetanks

@_taysimone you can't even write using correct grammar, and yet you think you're capable of "intellectual conversation", (eg, "make myself tangible" is literally meaningless, and sounds like something a toddler would say 😂) and yet again, you've confused yourself, I don't WANT A CONVERSATION WITH YOU, you're disgusting, I just want you to be honest about the REAL reason you're on private, it's cos you're absolutely terrified of what most of the Internet will tell you, and ps, just cos someone doesn't agree with you,  doesn't make them a "keyboard warrior," you dummy, it's just how ig works, derp, how are you even allowed out by yourself?? 😂

Shame on you @therock for supporting animal concentration camps! Animals are as you say intelligent and they also have feelings and needs which they are derived of when in captivity. How can you not only support this but also promote it? It’s so ignorant and selfish. Instead oh should use your fame to work against animal abuse. Please make the connection!

Its sad they have to live in small tanks in captivity. They can never be happy.
Follow me
@therock why would you do this? Why?
@poppygitsham can you explain to me the countless documents and research papers on animals in captivity that commit suicide because of their unhappiness in captivity?
👏👏😍
What an asshole!!! That Beluga doesn't  belong in that place!!! Use your head and not only your muscles!!!
Had enough of people and now  you're beating up sea animals. You are no longer the rock, you are the coral.
Always be a good person in ALL that you do, Gods Grace and Gods Love will follow you through!  Peace out ✌️
What. Are. You. Doing!!!! Do you even understand the cruelty behind these captive animals? They are literally in jail. Stolen often from their real habitats. Animals are NOT ours for entertainment or PROFIT. It’s disheartening in an age where you could have done an internet search about what you are promoting, the cruelty, exploitation, the health affects both physical and mentally to these animals that you could be so blind as to support such a thing.
So beautiful 💙💙💙
Disgusting. Get them out of those fucking fish tanks!

How you can promote that? When what WE NEED is TO END the demand for whale and dolphins shows....? Capturing and keeping whales and dolphins in captivity is deplorable. They are highly intelligent. They live in complex societies. But they are taken from their homes, separated from their families and confined for human entertainment. The open ocean is their home, and you should get there once, and feel it. It’s pathetic that in 2018 a human like you, is promoting something like that... Wake Up Dwayne, WAKE UP HUMANS. #LetLive

"Staggering intelligence, you got that right . But forced to live in captivity. Belugas in the wild dive to great depths , in captivity they are confined to a small area forced to swim in chlorinated water that makes their eyes sting . They cannot use their echolocation which is rendered useless in a tiny tank . Just think about it , how would you like to live in captivity? Confined to the one small room all of your life ? Please educate yourself on captivity! You’re a role model too many. You are sending out the wrong message to your fans . Please don’t be captivated by captivity! #captivitykills #emptythetanks #dontbuyaticket 
If you really loved them , you would not be supporting such cruelty."
Get woke Dwayne. Dolphinariums and another other place you go to that has intelligent cetaceans in captivity are disgusting. Visit Taiji in Japan or the Faroe Islands and discover the endless slaughters and selling of intelligent, social animals that have been torn from their families. Please don’t promote places like this. They are torture for the animals.
Shame on this photo!!! How can you promote this beautiful animal in captivity as a good thing? It’s notorious !!!!! Empty the fucking tanks !!!
@_taysimone die in freedom then live in slavery!!!
Raaaaaaaaaad

supporting animal cruelty isn't cool
It’s probably funnier than Kevin hart
Wow really so cute 😘 😍 ❤️
Rampage sequel !!!!!!! Yeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaassssss
How much awesome would it be if they weren’t held in captivity and were free to swim in the ocean like they were meant to before humans realised they could exploit them for financial gain
Twinz🤔
wow
@_taysimone on point propaganda.
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
@dolphin_project
Ffs. Was a fan. Massively disappointed in this.

@joelchrstnsn there is no need for insults. We are all part of a learning process. If there is something you can share to make others understand a situation then just do. You have no right to call a fellow human ignorant and stupid.
@la_croisson all zoos are bad zoos period...there are millions of acres of land and ocean across the world for preservation...non of which have animals popping up unnaturally to say hello.

Awesome bro
Whale eyes are mesmerizing
@all_things_art_48 it's because we made it bad for them to live in it, even if they're good for them. Tell mr how many of these lands have been exploited into holiday sites? Like at least 70% and people still won't stop hunting for them even if they're illegal. So imagine if they're released in these "preservation sites". Take a guess who's gonna hunt them down without caring if they're illegal or not
Cool
Not Good, Sorry to be negative as I love your work and positive posts but this was not positive, not cool, these Beautiful animals belong free in Mother nature, Please use your platform carefully as the next generation look up to you!!! All the best x

Ha moj ha
Wow, I leider be these whales ❤️❤️❤️ they are so beautiful 💛💚🧡
@_celegarcia_  omfg!!
Unfollowing... you can’t grant freedom to a wild animal. You can’t stick it in a tank and say you’re helping it out. You can’t starve them into performing tricks, then call them intelligent whilst denying them their true potential within the ocean within their social structure
@marinaaruy
Awwwww
Nice pic bro
@louroc09 BELOUGA ÉCHOUÉ ❤
Beautiful
Wow, this is cool. Amazing
@alicia_loreena @_irina_laura belugaa😉❤️
Aw
@_taysimone if the animals are really in the best interest of GA aquarium then it's fair to say that they aren't exploited at all? Because the sea sheapards get a ton of money (more then they need) and have yet the need to open an "aquarium". If the animals that you guys saved were released back into the wild once they've recovered then perhaps it's a good thing and only those which absolutely cannot fend for them selves in the wild due to a major injury or something similar are kept then fine but don't one second think an aquarium could ever be enough to give a whale all it needs. An aquarium isn't an ocean and that's just a fact.
😍😍😍😍😍😍
This animal should not be in captivity.
Its The Rock

@therock I'm surprised at you. It should be free in the ocean and not stuck in a glass tank
Not impressed that an actor of your calibre is promoting the cruel captive whale and dolphin industry by posting something like this. Every day in those tanks is mental torture for them. They belong in the sea not in an aquarium.

Beluga whales are amazing creatures, typically found in the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions of our planet, who generally live together in pods. These intelligent and social animals are robbed by aquariums, specially this one, and they have a horrible and boring life @therock

@r2d9000 I see you replying on every comment that you don't agree with. Are you bored? What are you,12?? Why do you have to be so rude?? People can think and say whatever they want! Plus it's true, these animals shouldn't be in captivity! It's simple, rescue or not, animals belong in the wild. And if they're rescued, fine! But why do they have to make them perform stupid tricks and shit?!! Money! So you shut up!!
Bad move dude!!
This is sad. You’re promoting the captivity of animals that have been stolen from their homes. Please, please take this down and re-evaluate the message you’re sending.
You lost, the whale played paper and you played rock. #feelsbadman
Is this one going to grow huge after drug-abuse aswell? And then tear down a city because something pissed it off
❤️❤️❤️❤️
@zanajade_ if you want to see whats happening to the ocean right now, the runoff from lake okeechobee is causing a lot of fish to die in the gulf of florida. Its no joke.

@gemmak_14x IKKKK
@therock so when you're "in awe" of something, you lock it up in a tiny tank and make it perform tricks?? That's your definition of "awe"?? Wow. Shame on you for promoting such an outdated cruel act (and maybe look up what the word awe actually means)
makes me really sad to see that beauty prisoned 😓😔
No!!!
😍😍😍
Awww!
Meu wi
Same haircut 😆 @therock
Soooooooo cutttttte

@therock  If you care even slightly about these intelligent animals, then you should know that they belong in the wild
@therock They wanna be free bro, like you. Not locked up. Think about it. @warriorforanimals
This is really awesome 😍
There is nothing entertaining about wild animals being caged and exploited for human entertainment. Shame on you
Классно чувак!!

No!!! Belugas and any other cetacean do not belong in captivity unless it is a legitimate sanctuary for rehabilitation and release. So disappointed, I really thought you were a good guy.

@poppygitsham I rescue animals. I donate 40% of my business to animal shelters . I travel to China and rescue animals from the dog / cat meat trade .. what do you ? Just because someone doesn’t post about it on social media doesn’t mean they are not doing incredible things .. you sound so Lovely . . I rather hate on ppl over not caring for animals. Then hate on people for standing up for them..

Dude just help these creatures find their real home-sea.... they dont belong to man made sea world @peta

@_taysimone so you seriously believe they're better off in one of your disgusting, tiny tanks, performing tricks and being petted by celebrities?? Really?? That's your honest opinion?? #DELUSIONAL (No wonder your account is on private, I'd advise you to keep it that way, otherwise some kind person might decide to "rescue" YOU , and throw you in a tank for the rest of your life, but only for your own good, of course) 🙄

Not a real dolfin..but #Awesome
@therock please no 😔 you have the power to EDUCATE and influence people - please don’t choose to promote captivity 💔

Lovely
So cute #baluga
Shouldn’t be in some tank! Should be roaming freely in the ocean 🖕🏻
@poppygitsham humans can and will justify anything. Well done human! Take your research papers, build an enclosure 1/100 of what you currently have and lock yourself in. You’ll be taught tricks and fed over-microwaved dinners...As you said, you wouldn’t have to “lift a fin” 😂 .... as if wild animals don’t enjoy “the work” of living a free! Get over yourself!

Love is in the air ❤️😇
@therock advocate for their freedom. They are not here for our amusement
don t support aquariums !
Ahhhh so beautiful 😍
Free the whales!!!
Ha ha.. now who can actually say.  They first bumped a beluga whale?  What a magical creature
No no no no no. Captivity limits and shortens thede beautiful creatures lives. There is a push in Ireland to highlight these animals plight and several huge holiday companies have dropped collaborations with #seaworld etc. Please Rock. Come and unsupport whale captivity...
@recampagnola No, they don't. Not all of them. Believe It or not, the Truth is that some of these people actually HELP them in the moments they would had die due to human footprint, Pollution, hunting, climate change. Again, not all of them suck. I don't support aquariums and Zoos but I did my researches and the Georgia's is a good place. They don't keep animals for profit, just to let them live because they couldn't survive in the wild.. infact, they release the ones who can.
@nerrges hahahahhaha
This animal should not be being exploited to make movies for human entertainment.. very disappointed 💔

@chris_mitchell16 you so sad mate. It’s about the animals you fud, not the people. If people really wanted to appreciate these animals then there is no better place than in their natural habitats. Stop being so selfish. And if people can’t afford to see them - tough.
@poppygitsham Watch Born to be free. Even if it's a 'rescue', it is a fact that these animals can be released again. Their families are extensive, these are extremely sentient and smart animals. They would recognize each other after 20 years.
ماشاء الله داداش 💪

@tunbvckes hahaha aww😂😘😘
"And the Beluga Whale is awesome too." Your caption made me laugh so thanks for the humour on this ridiculous work Monday (Australia here!). 😆😆 👏👏
@sam.eatbread yeah I saw! Cool!
It's kinda hard to see such magnificent creature kept in aquarium ..... sorry if that was offensive
Nyc
Such beautiful creatures
@maddihenderson Watch 'Born to be free'. It's a docu about belugas BOUGHT by this aquarium. These babies are stolen from their families in the Ochotsk sea and await their doom in tiny tubs near the big blue ocean. Any other explanations or so-called facts are meaningless, this is the truth.
👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
NOT COOL DUDE. Educate yourself
😔 😢
Omg I luv those animals ❤️
Awesome:)

Not cool. Probably starved of food to get it to do this 'trick'.
Not Cool Dwayne.....you should know better. You just normalized holding sentient animals captive with this pic for people who aren't aware this is wrong.
Well this is disappointing.. with all the information out there @therock how can you support such cruelty? These incredibly magnificent animals are literally stolen from the ocean and forced to live in tiny tanks and perform for humans. If you truly appreciate this beautiful animal, you should not have gone to see it in an aquarium. You’re also telling your millions of followers that exploiting animals for entertainment is just fine. Please take this into consideration! 🙏🏻
@bfd_bob good one 👊🏼
👌👌👌
You should get one of those.
Noooooo 💔 please don’t support this captivity 😢imagine being taken from the ocean and forced into a tank. It’s like living in a bathtub for them. Their freedom is worth more than this 💔
Beluga whale! I love it. Keep grinding
😍😍😍😍
Soft flex.
😢😢😢 heartbreaking 💔 This animal (and others in the same situation; captivity and forced animal entertainment/ encounters) deserves better! @therock please use your platform to be their voice since they don't speak our language... 🙏
Con amici così come si può sconfiggere il beluga!? @daniel.cuello
@kathbourne
Please watch the documentary 'Born to be free'. The beluga version of 'Blackfish'. A sad and scandalous story of 28 belugas languishing in tiny tanks (and dying!) in Russia because aquariums like these 'order' these animals. The smaller grey young ones are put in bathtubs waiting on transport to aquaria all around the world. These 18 were supposed to be SOLD to Georgia aquarium, but animal advocates managed to issue a ban on the importation. And Georgia aquarium couldn't care less what happens with them now. They could be released but now Russia just sells them to another partner (or they die in the meantime). Rescues? My *ss.

No no no! Even if this aquarium is a rescue or ‘ethical’ then some of your followers will see this as a green light to visit torture parks like @seaworldorlando . Intelligent, sentient beings should not be ripped apart from their families and kept in horrendous tanks 😔 Google the Japanese whale and dolphin hunts, watch Blackfish and maybe spread a better message

@simon.metcalf.9 😂
😍😍😍❤️
What a terrible post. I'm so disappointed. With CGI there is no need for animals in movies, not that it was ever a worthy excuse to keep them in captivity. How insulting to take these beings from the ocean to teach them to shake hands and do trucks. Even if it is a rescue as so many claim then it should be rehabilitated and returned to the wild. If returning isn't an option then it should be allowed to express natural behaviors and live as naturally as possible. This isn't natural at all.

Que pasada.......tu si que eres una estrella
🐋❤
Does anyone know where this animal is? Does anyone know if its a rescue? Like wow, some of you act like he put the animal there on purpose, and lets not act like alot of you havent been to a zoo in your life. Some animals need rescued, some animals cant live in the wild thanks to the way people treat this earth, and the lack of food vital to survive. How do we know if this isnt the exact reasoning behind why this animal is there. Alot of animals in captivity are resucues, and if you put them back, they will surely die. I dont support putting animals in captivity,  but this problem is bigger than just  putting them back. We have to tackle climate change, overfishing, catching and charging the people who capture them, saving animals from extinction, stopping big game hunting,( giraffes, lions, elephants, ect) sooo many other things we barely have touched on. This is just my opinion. Everyone is entitled to their own.

I think you are amazing, but supporting aquariums that keep animals locked up is not something I can support. #disappointed
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
@therock in chlorine water slowly going mad. Don't help out aquariums. The way they get the animals there is horrible. Please. Read up on them 💚
@sunipal I'm against any form of captivity but I did my research on Georgia Acquarium and they're really good. They only keep animals that can't return to the wild, and release the ones they rehabilitate and can survive in the wild. So basically, I agree with what you say, but we need to make a difference between the parks (both zoo sanctuaries and acquariums) that actually do a conservation work, from the ones who just keep animals for profit. Not all humans suck. I was disappointed with @therock the first time I saw this post but then I've read the hashtag Georgia Aquarium. I'm sure he did his own research too not to support any kind of Sea World park.
😊😊😊
@ollie_hudson_ omg!!! My time will come, you just wait it will be me posting pictures with a beluga on day
Wow!

Aquariums are not ethically sound. First time disappointed in the Rock.
You support aquariums? I have been shocked to see this. 😡
😍😍 nice 👍🏼
What the fuck ... grow up man ..
Hey Dwayne, you probably won’t see my post, but man. Have you heard of the Vaquita. There is only 12 left in the entire world how sad is that. This dolphin is very beautiful but I just wish the killings of these poor and rare animals stops, I do understand the corrupt countries and why some of the fisherman do kill very rare creatures so they may make profit, not saying I’m supporting th slaughter, I understand souley why it is done. Anyways, your a celeb multi millionaire, if I was you man, I would use all my time to set up a fund page for it or something, invest good money and time into something that is so very very serious!
I really like dwayne jhonson,you so cool without tatoo🙏🙏
🐬👌
@therock your an awesome dude. But this post is so saddening. Please watch @blackfish - including everyone who thinks this is cool. An enormous sea mammal such as this, and others like orcas and dolphins - with profound emotional and intellectual understanding, DO NOT deserve a life in such captivity. The means to this end - the submission of such animals so they can be ‘trained’ is insufferable. Please look into this further - #emptythetanks or visit @thedolphinproject. Sea mammals that are injured or what ever the excuse is, do not belong in captivity - help in small concrete tanks when performing and then even smaller holding pens when not required for our entertainment. These animals are either taken from their mothers at a very young age when bred in captivity or stolen from their pods in the wild - a hugely traumatic event for these animals that live many many decades. Imagine 30 or 40 years in captivity...
Beautiful
The Rock is so loveable he's made Dwayne a cool name
Love a good old animal activist, humans are destroying there natural habitats and over fishing the oceans, so there food supply is minimal. How about you all start being more conscious and eat less your selfs and you might save the wild
empty the tanks @daniclutton_

@therock as an educated global figure we ask you to rise to your influence now and take down this picture, or explain yourself. Whales do not belong in captivity, wild animals should not be made to do tricks. Your portrayals of strength, commitment to improvement and education seem extremely opposed to promoting an extremely dated, cruel and inhumane commercial practice. For people who actually care about these animals and their livelihood, this post will change their opinion and support of you forever. People fucking care about this - a lot. Please rise and be who we thought you were
@formerhunter just because I am listing things that sanctuaries do too, it doesn't negate the work that good zoos and aquariums do. I can recognise and give credit to both. Of course they get subsidies. That also goes back into a lot of the great work they do for animals around the world. Yes, the world revolves around money and people will try to make a profit out of it, but that money is also helping to protect animals. You keep telling me to go look online, you can also look at many different zoos websites and see the good projects they have contributed too. There are many places where we can't protect animals in the wild and captivity is one of the results of that. Not everything is black and white. Nice discussing it with you.
@therock then set it free it doesn't belong in that tiny tank

Anyway I don’t mind what you do really, you just seem so closed minded and are trying to keep up a personality of a rich guy. Which you aren’t by the way you just have some money 😂
@therock Please chech @ricobarrydolphinproject and you'll also see where these dolphins come from, September 1st the dolphin hunting season is going to start again, beautiful dolphins captured from the wild are sold to sea parks all around the world, entire families of dolphins slaughtered in front of the few terrorised members who have been chosen for captivity, mothers are separated from calfs and slaughtered in front of them 😢😢😢💔💔💔please see it's all documented through videos...

How sad this is. Truly disappointed he uses social media to promote this. Intelligent animals are Beluga whales and they belong to their natural habitat.
Beautiful pic. These beautiful animals (mammals), however,  are extremely sentient and should not be kept in captivity.
Top q lindo
@therock ..i bet he would look much more beautiful if he were free
@therock please don't support captivity there's cruelty and abuse behind this photo, these poor animals are condemned to a life sentence in a pool, obliged to perform in front of a paying audience in exchange for food... frozen fish which is not natural for them... what's more their sonar largely used in the wild for detecting obstacles keep on returning waves to them when hitting the pool walls, can you imagine how painful?  In the wild they swim free hundreds kms a day...

It's Bailey!! 🤣
Super
Wahh
Do you want to stay in a cage like him ??? I thought you were an intelligent and open mind guy... I was wrong 😡
Please watch Black Fish :(!
Cruel to support animal in captivity. Perhaps this beautiful animal would be happier free and wild.
@seu.manel , o Daniel conheceu the rock e nem falou. Marca ele ai
Wow awesoem man
He’d be even more awesome in his natural habitat 😏
When the @therock finds someone who's just as big and bald as him ♡
He’s  gorgeous😍♥️🙏🏻🙏🏻
About to deliver the People's flipper lol
As awesome as it may seem but Dwayne this is not good for this 🐬
@lilshawty702 I care very much about this cause. But... sometimes what we perceive as “captivity” isn’t always captivity until we know the whole story.... and sometimes, even when it is straight up captivity, captivity is the best option for the human community. I’m no expert. It’s just my take. I am in no way supporting cruelty to animals. Peace.
Cute
Bailey 😍
Nice
Owsm
Love this
i think i need to be ur next co-star :)
Rock its so beautiful
Should this animal be in an aquarium? #freetheorcas
Caged animal😔
Should have arm wrestling shots too
Thats so cute!!! I wanna pet it!
NICE WALE IT MAKES ROCK LOOK SMALL HAHAHA
@therock I do love you as an actor but this makes me sad, these animals are not meant to be in captivity. They are used to swimming hundreds of miles a day in the ocean but they are being kept in tiny tanks and used as performers.. #savethewhales #notforcaptivity #blackfish
That water tho 👌🏾
😠😠😠😠😠😠 BOYCOTT MARINE PARCS !!!!!
Should be wild and free in the ocean. Nice of you to support this.... #therocksucks
Please don't support these types of Aquariums. :(

@louna_s73 je prefer les baleines a bosse

@darkitect_aks I emphasize the difference between pet and wild animal. However, concerning the excessive crossing of certain breeds, and the drifts of the hypertype, i don't endorse either but it's the result of years of selection induced by the human unfortunately. Although the dog lives much more serenely life in captivity than a wild animal snatched from his natural environment.
Woww....😎😎

I know you also have Mother Nature on your side as well, @therock 😌🙏🏻🍃💦🐬🐳🐋
@dragoonace so your answer to my question is that they fund helping animals by harming them?? “Let’s capture them, put them on display, make money off them in order to help and protect them.” Don’t you see the contradiction? Don’t you think a huge thing we should be protecting them from having to live a life in captivity?? And I pointed out that many sanctuaries and rescues are thriving to prove that’s it’s easily possible...you can look up their business practices yourself...there’s tons of them...with big animals too.
Wow it's beautiful! 😍
@itsjustreece123 trying to lock in the rock bottom

They are not supposed to be in an aquarium doing tricks 😔 shame on you for supporting things like this. WAKE UP.

Hey idiot. That beluga has a miserable life in captivity, do not promote that!
We shouldn't support aquariums!
These beautiful animal belongs to nature 😕
No animal should be in an aquarium, so sad, stolen lives 😔

Would be better to see this beautiful beast in natural waters. I understand the inclination but these creatures are not here to titillate us or shake our hands. I forgive you tho - your oral sex clap back to 'that fool' means you're still wearing a crown.
Cute
@jufreyja trop chou
@darkitect_aks (sorry for my english again)  i'm not agree... the dog results of the domestication of the wolf by the man. When simplifying, the wolf brought protection to human, which in return, provided him food. It's social impregnation, at the beginning, but by the active selection of man to create the dog (tamer), it's the origin of domestication. It makes thousands years that the dog has adapted to the condition of human life, we talk about pet, which is unparalleled as the wild animal that we pulled out overnight to his natural environment by confronting it front our demands, whereas the latter considers us for the most part (and it's totally justified) as predators. No, we will not comparate a cat to a tiger because precisely, it has evolved in order to adapt to our human life (size, docilety...) and had a considerable time to do it. (The time of evolution...). A tiger knows has known only his natural environment, it's inconceivable to think that he can live in the same conditions as a cat... Same as for marine mammals...
cute😍

@therock if you seriously love dolphins.... join @dolphin_project and help end their torture in places you just visited. 🐬wild free animals locked up in small pools with clorine water, to be taught to "high five" its a shame to waste their intelligence.🐬❤️
How can you be in “awe” of a creature stuck in a swimming pool?! Why not go and see them in the wild... it’s not like you couldn’t afford to go. Help empty the tanks instead please 😓🐠

@louna_s73 mais omg cest quoi cette img sur laquelle tu viens de m'identifier
Wtf!!!!! @therock
What an idiot promoting this @youngmadz
@the_v_review the reason they teach them this is to actually be checked over to ensure they are in good health. The way they are trained is for positive reinforcement only. Just like training a dog to sit and giving it a treat for doing so. So by being able to do this a vet can more easily see if there is any issue/ what the issue with the animal to keep it in the best health possible. All I can say is that the people who care for these animals care for them, so very very very much. They are family to keepers.
With all respect these animals belong in nature:(
Ultimate dream @aurelieblanch

"Awesome post man❤️
Check @fitnationplus

Support for an aquarium means support for the practice of capturing wild animals from their natural habitat where they are used to roaming long distances, and putting them in tiny tanks for human entertainment. It’s really not okay.
Your veins... ❤️👩‍⚕️💪💉
They really need to stop capturing and keeping animals in captivity just for human amusement. This beauty belongs to nature not in any aquarium

Wooooooow!!! Did you know that there are scientist that believe that Dolphins are smarter than human beings? They have a bigger brain than we do and they communicate at high pitches using what some researchers believe is a highly developed language 15,000 times faster than we can talk. They've developed sonar capabilities and can even differentiate between different types of materials under water, their shapes, sizes and possibly more. Wild dolphins can swim at up to speeds 40mph and dive up to a depth of 300 feet (I think), deeper than even trained divers using an oxygen tank. Porpoises/dolphins I believe are the most underrated creaters on Earth! It is incredible to see my favorite action hero (this century) about to make a movie with my favourite creature, dolphins. Wooooooow!!! You rock Mr Dwyane!!

Don't support animals kept in captivity.  They are stolen from their families and habitat to be put in a tanl for people to make profit. Made to perform tricks and intetact with humans. If ot was the other way around and people were kidnapped and made to perform for profit.. Think about it...Educate yourself. Dont support it.

@sunipal I get it, but that is a one sided documentary. It states oppinion and out of contaxt facts, rather than relevant facts for both sides so that its audience can take an informed stance on the issue. Im not saying that animals should or shouldnt be  in aquariums, just saying thatthere is good and bad on both sides and that people should make informed decisions rather than watching propaganda

Awe dayuummmm
@therock these beautiful animals are not here for our amusement. You could have easily gone out in the open sea and watch them ‘happy’ with their families. They are taken away from their families( mothers most likely killed) when they are babies and abused their whole life for human entertainment. They can’t swim, can’t hunt and are totally dependent on their caretakers for food and other nourishment. They start displaying depressing behaviour where they don’t come up at all. People like us, who are nobody, start realising these things. A child will tell you if the poor animal is happy or not. Why does it become so easy when we grow up to ignore the pain and suffering of others and become selfish? Please take responsibility of your posts and preach reality to your 112 million followers

@lecosses so i studied for years. Have worked closely with these animals and with the keepers who care so dearly for these animals. Read countless research. Yet you've not done any of those things and made an opinion on something you know nothing about...and im the ignorant one? Wow. What exactly do you do to help animals in the wild? Do you recycle? Do you use reusable bottles?  Do you donate to conservation charities? Do you learn about marine debris, poaching and the illegal pet trade? Or do you just sit there behind your keyboard, hating on the people who are giving their time to actually help these creatures?
Animal cruelity 😪😪
You shouldn't be condoning this.

@brianworldchamp it’s not semantics. the difference is that sanctuaries and rescues don’t breed, capture, buy/sell.

Now you ready to fight Aquaman ( @prideofgypsies ) mr.Adams 😀
Gotta ♥️ .. the 🐳 ! 🤣🤣
No animal ever, ever, ever belongs in a cage. No matter what. Every living creature on this earth deserves the right to live in their natural habitat. This, this is not their natural habitat. It is a prison that they are forced to live in. Can you live with the fact that because you posted this picture that you are supporting the continuation of this foul practice?

@brianworldchamp yes, they actually do still. They are doing it less and less because more and more people are letting them know they think it’s wrong, but they still do.  And they breed a lot... bringing an animal into this world just to live on display in cages...we need to move away from those practices.
@therock you are an awesome fellow Johnson I'm so glad that you are enjoying the same state as I am God bless you and it was going to being honor as always 2 ketchup with a growing masterpiece like you Hamden middle finest

@brianworldchamp no they just buy them for other people that go into the wild and hunt them. So technically you are correct. Almost all people don't like seeing dogs or cats being mistreated but other animals is okay for them

@popski625 I agree with you, cross breeding and keeping them in collar and in not so appropriate weather conditions... Dogs are facing serious health issues... And pugs are most severe in the list...That's equally inhuman and I guess you didn't save them out of the wild... no animals should be harmed for pleasure purposes...

@formerhunter you don't know his zoos or aquariums protect animals? They fund conservation projects all over the world, they provide places where humans can learn to appreciate animals and why they should care about and protect them, and they take part in breeding projects for endangered species as well as fund research into animal illnesses. FYI, you never answered my question, how do you get the money to help the creatures that rescues and sanctuaries can't help? Just because you know some that do well, usually these are ones that focus on small creatures that require less attention and staff. on the whole it is a massive struggle, especially with more complicated animals such as sea creatures or larger more dangerous animals. You need specialist equipment, medical care, staff on hand 24 hours a day, food etc. How is this going to be paid for? As I said, donations don't cover it and governments won't when they can't even look after humans in need. Your viewpoint is admirable, but it simply isn't feasible.
@oh.manell how come you got to meet the rock?!!
@theotherkg STOPPPPPP
Please don't support aquariums who use whales and dolphins as a way to make money.
@therock man i really wasnt expecting you to be a supporter of animal abuse
@blackfish_movie this is like seeing a horror movie
#emptythetanks @therock big fan but this is not cool to work alongside the cruelty of the confinement industry. These “awesome” and “staggeringly intelligent” animals don’t belong in a swimming pool. Heighten your awareness of how this industry is fed. Please..... become a powerful voice against not a reason to line pockets of these hideous corporations.

$60 feeds a manta ray for 1 day!
$200 gives 1 injured veteran the chance to immerse themselves in a whale shark dive encounter!
$500 feeds 1 adult green sea turtle for 1 month!
So now tell me, in which option are they helping towards conservation... Positive things for the animals outside the aquarium... As you said. Dude, wake the fuck up"

Beautiful animals like that belong in the sea, i don’t know if rescuing them and putting them in a tank is the best option for them I think it’s more to make us humans feel better about ourselves. But they do definitely not belong on a movie screen. You should know better than @therock. No movie or money in the world is worth making animals suffer.

@therock I love you more than my mama does but why promote aquariums? Dolphins and whales don't belong there. Neither does sharks or orcas❤ and for the haters; even if "rescued" they don't belong in a profit making aquarium where people go for entertainment. A sanctuary would be better.

@formerhunter I'm trying to have a reasonable discussion with you, let's not start nailing our opinions to masts. I have researched this topic a lot. Volunteer rescues and sanctuaries struggle to operate and donations only go so far. If we rely on them, many animals will go unprotected. So in your scenario, where does the money come from to fund the rest of the animals protection
@saylawayxo smh he did nothing wrong
Cute
😻😻🐬🐠
@therock so, instead of letting those whales 🐋 swim up to 100 miles a day you support to keep them caged in a pool? That’s what I get from the picture and your comment.
Is it real
Loll. Caught that. Lol
@karo_thr
@saylawayxo this kind of animal is going extinct in the real world, these aquariums only rescued them so they don't die out in the wild, i agree that animals should be allowed to roam free but you can't exactly judge him just because he posted a picture of himself interacting with an animal in captivity. do some research first before you talk shit

@sunipal I scrolled for this type of comment. Because of human action in the seas, marine life is dying, because of good human action marine life is being studied and saved by some of these sanctuaries. Profit driven humans will profit from badly run sanctuaries and good people will try and save the seas from pollution and over fishing. There's good and bad in all human action, it's much more complicated than 'That's bad' and 'thats good'. I imagine @therock left a substantial donation that helps research and development as well so chill 😁🌴💚👊🏻

@popski625 yes I have domesticated cats - that is totally different and you know it. I didn't like birdworld and won't be going back - those penguins shouldn't be there either. I talked about it with our daughter and we agreed that it wasn't right. It's not a rescue or breeding programme.
❤🐋❤🐋❤
Amazing picture 😮✌🏻 great shot
One day the dolphins will take over...
Awesome one
Ooooo
@therock yes this beautiful animal is staggering with intelligence but seriously why support this cruelty...rescue rehabilitate and release not rescue, rehabilitate and make money by allowing human interaction in a concrete tank ?!!? If deemed in releasable then keep it in a much bigger tank away from prying eyes and allow it in a more natural habitat and not train it to entertain visitors ! #theyarenotourentertainment you should know better than to tell your followers that this is ok 💔🤯
I'm shocked I just look at their page and they have a whale shark there. I've swam in the wild with these in the Maldives and tgey are huge I can't believe they are in a tank. 😯
💓❤💓❤💓❤
@poppygitsham Hahah. You think just like employer on seaworld back in the day. Cause a dolphin jumps and to flips It's auto happy?
Lovely
!!wow!! He or she must be trained

Wow. I thought you were smarter than this @therock . Shame on you for promoting whale captivity.
Inspirational pic of the year
They really are awsome so instead of promoting their slavement advocate for their freedom please
Nc
U look huger than him 😂
@ezhil_blake I suppose it's one thing to keep them for protection but making them do tricks and showing them to crowds of people is different. Not a natural type setting. It's that sort of using for human entertainment that gets people annoyed I think?
supporting animal captivity is very bad,  Big Nope 👎
This pic makes me so sad. The exploitation of poor animals for human amusement is disgusting!! 😥
😍😍😍😍😍
Prachtig
@maddihenderson what are you like 16? But you know more, right? 🙄🙄🙄 Go to church child.
You did and did your dad stop calling you okay
@dragoonace Ur way off. First, how are we protecting them by putting them in captivity and exploiting them??? Seems like they should be protected from exactly that. As far as helping animals that need help without breeding and capturing, it IS possible....Volunteer at an animal rescue/sanctuary some time and ask them. Also, you can find all the info online.

Uso si u delfinariju
Nooo ffs. You know better than this. Animals are NOT for our entertainment and they are NOT to play tricks in movies. Please do your research on these animals - how they are in the wild and how they are in captivity. This is not natural - please do not advocate this. You’re better than this.
Someday... 💗🙏🏼 magic
Will bestimmt lieber im Meer schwimmen!!!
💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
@formerhunter we have seen time and time again we cannot protect them in the wild, so I don't see how that goal is achievable. There are too many species where captivity isn't only necessary, it is vital. Then you still have to fund these places that do such an important job, so I don't see any way around this and no one has ever told me a realistic solution to these issues.
Kdk
This is absolutely amazing how lucky you are 😊👍
@poppygitsham they can tell how they are Living in the wild, how they have. Problem or not? A real rescue would put them back in the wild. Its just propaganda to say they give them a 'better' life, and they make money on them. It's bs, the whole business is
@nikkohurtado this is not awesome at all
This beautiful creature should be free in the ocean...
😊👊
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuwwwww (finding dorry)
Che belloooooooo 🐬
@_taysimone also, you say they are trained to do this trick? How do they train them? I bet it's not by letting them be animals and leaving them the fuck alone. 🤷‍♀️

@redden12301 I have seen plenty of marine life in the wild and I'm Not rich. It's great for people to be able to see and educate themselves about these creatures but having them do tricks in tiny tanks isn't cool and totally unnecessary.
#emtpythetanks
What a beautiful moment
You should watch The Cove and Blackfish....
@lecosses if they wouldn't survive in the wild why put them back just to die? Watch finding Dory, gives the same message but slightly more on your level.
Wow😍😍😍

My man..superb post
@poppygitsham do you know that they wont survive? Cause thats really not the case
Love it..
@maddihenderson go on then... What are we missing that makes these sorts of places OK and Defensible? Do tell...
@josh_livermore99 oh god forbid @dyne7 voices their opinion😂😂
@lecosses 😂😂😂😂😂 I've worked in zoos for years. My job title is a 'wildlife educator'. I can quote you 100s of research papers to show you how happy and healthy these animals are. But will you read any of them? Nope
@johnny_kreveta oh shit u met the rock
Seriously uncool man. Very disappointed to see that you would support the captivity of these beautiful, intelligent animals.
Why does a man like you support these animal prisons?
Amazing is that real
@_taysimone you sound just like the employees of SeaWorld. Spouting off the bs party line about how "your whales live longer in captivity than they would in nature". 🙄 Where have we heard that before? 🤔🙄
Shame its in an aquarium no matter how large 😢
Everyone that's is crying and saying they lost respect is a bitch
Блин вы так похоже что я даже не понял сразу кто есть кто.😂
Can I call him Mamoote

In captivity???
@_taysimone so they're better off in a tank?
Does kinda look like you're punching it!
so cutee 😍❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ahhh man! Such a shame, I liked you.  #educateyourself #blackfish #emptythetanks
So you accept captivity
Sorry..dislike!!

Awwww maaaan! Nooooooooo, this isn't good. It would be great to see you promoting the end of animals doing tricks for human entertainment! If you think it's such a special animal, why would you support it being kept in a tank for people to stare at? Imagine that for humans? @therock Please think again dude x
@kevin_waddell_venom_ well since you're obviously the expert why don't you point out the bad parks to us so that we can condemn them😂
Funn

As awesome as I think you are, this is not cool. This is animal abuse; these belong in the wild and not in a tank. You should research and see how these intelligent creatures are captured and maybe you would do something to put a stop to it 😢
Oh, same hairstyle!!!
@fatimabegum_
@_taysimone Rescue is an excuse for every aquarium. This is still an aquarium not a rescue or sanctuary.
No way that really
@lecosses 😂😂😂😂 why would she lie? And why would a 'marinbiolagy' as you so eloquently put it, know where these animals came from?

Aw come on man! Don’t support aquariums! Disappointing!
Viejo feo horrible
Paul would be proud of what u have accomplished
😍😍😍💪💪💪
They are not supposed to be in an aquarium. By posting this picture you are supporting other families who come to watch them here. Which generates massive income for these aquarium. In turn more of these beautiful creatures are taken in captivity from their natural environment. These intelligent creatures are to be left in the wild. Not interacted with humans. If at all ,then in their natural surroundings. You can dive with them. But not in an aquarium! Also they are trained to be funny and learn these tricks. Which is not their natural behaviour. Which in absolutely unfair.
This is very interesting
@_taysimone sadly your educated arguments are falling on idiotic ears. And that is exactly why we are loosing this battle.
Awwe 🐳
Yoo Bro ... whazzz up ...
Awsome
So cute❤
Beautiful
@_taysimone Thank You for all your work and I hope to visit this aquarium some day!
@_taysimone all wild animals are facing same problems because humans. Should we put them all in tanks or cages because of that? Or should we fix the problem with nature?
Awesome photo of man and beast, or 2 beasts 😍😍
Adorable

Please don’t support or promote aquariums, it’s just a prison, they belongs to nature 😢

These animals are mostly rescue and if they were to be put in the ocean they'd die. They're treated like kings and queens and its a perfect place for education and conservation. From all those who work in zoos and aquariums, thank you!!! 😍

Am so disappointed in you. What is wrong. This endangered Beluga was torn away from its family to live in small filthy toxic pool. Thev all die and this has nothing to do with conservation. Please get in touch with conservation group to understand the truth. Lend your fame and name to setting them set free#emptythetanks
More like found my new screen saver.
@waresty @jimgaffigan 👉🏼ooooooo👈🏼

Definitely need to give us some more information about why it's in an aquarium. Does not look cool to me.
If it’s a rescue than fine but shaking hands and kissing people and performing is no for me.
That’s a bit phenomenal jokes that is phenomenal

For all of you individuals taking a shot at the Rock for posting a picture and stating your opinion on how this is so inhumane, that this is animal cruelty, etc. Instead of ridiculing him, why don't each and every one of you who is making your comment, GET OFF OF THIS PICTURE, off of Instagram in general, and go out, and make a change, make a difference? Promote a walk, a 5k, join a organization to save these animals you are claiming you so deeply care about as you stated in these comments? Change begins with you, not with your disrespectful comments to him. He's not missing any sleep, are you Dwayne?
@scubagodrich 😔 so sad, I appreciate we don’t know how the whale got here but I’m sure it would prefer being in the wild than being cooped up in an aquarium

@_taysimone I was at the GA aquarium and saw the tank from the top.. it was NOT big! There were 2 belugas in there and there was barely space for both of them to swim. I get that they are rescued and I suppose the aquarium needs the money from visitors to pay for the animals needs but they should do I little better with the size if the tanks, since they are pretty big mammals
@kevin_waddell_venom_ the goal is simple, no wild animal should be in captivity unless is absolutely necessary. Breeding, and capturing should be illegal. Zoos and aquariums can transition to sanctuaries and rescues!

@destinycalling
@indominus16extinction Yes, it does. I don’t have illusions of this animals happiness in prison. He’s dying inside.

@mrs.decane Aber @therock ist doch gar nicht so weiss...🤔😜
Im sure you have good intentions but you seem to be missing the point that that beautiful intelligent animal that awes you does not deserve to be in captivity with only a tiny fraction of the space in comparison to its natural habitat. This animal doesn't need you to be in awe, or to admire it, (I highly doubt it gives 2 shits about social media and being on TV) it needs your respect for a right to freedom, free choice, not to be kept in a cage. Theyre not free to leave, for no other reason than to make money from them, thats a prison. I used to love going the zoo and I still get so torn over the topic but sometimes we have to think about others and realise that just because it makes us happy it doesn't make this right, it makes it selfish. If you love the animal, put their needs first. And if the film blackfish and tilikum have taught us anything, its that this is not for the good of this seemingly happy but regardless forever used and imprisoned animal. With all the money, opportunity and privaledge that you have go to a facility that study's these animals in nature for their conservation and you will see the difference. They will show you how truly amazing these animals are and what they really need from you. You obviously care and have potential to do a lot of good, please do your research.
Not good! These intelligent animals should be free!

@diaryofafitmommyofficial The Georgia Aquarium doesn’t rescue or release animals - at least get your facts straight.
👏
Magic 😲😊
@maddihenderson single serious abuse cases in our society actually impact entire social policy and legislations. One is all it takes to learn the lesson. Ask the facts from people who study and care for these animals in their natural habitat. I'm sure they can provide you with all the facts we don't know. With complex social systems and intelligence it's the equivalent of being locked in your room your whole life. Although with the extent of their daily natural travel distance it's probably more like a cupboard.

This makes me so sad @therock . Have you asked yourself where these beautiful creatures came from and how they got there? What ‘the cove’ I beg you and you won’t have anything to do with this industry.  I love your work and you seem such a compassionate man so I beg you to look into this and say no! X
Is dat real or na

Ti somiglia!
Tristeza enorne no verla libre en su habitat @therock
I am a huge fan of @therock but this is really sad and I’m really surprise he would promote such a beautiful creature’s chronic suffering within captivity for the purpose of human ‘entertainment’. Come on, this is not new news to anyone! Aquariums should not be holding these intelligent mammals.
Nyc
"@therock no living being should live in a tank, aquarium, or cage. No living being should ever have freedom to roam taken from it. Ever.
@therock what if that was you or your daughter? Your beautiful light would have been dimmed. Living beings are not for our entertainment and profit. It’s not right."
Very nyc
I love u rock
Soo cute😘
That’s so cute 😂😍😌
Nothing cuter than an animal stolen from its family and forced to live in captivity I guess
So lovely animal l nid mine too like that

Omg 😱
@jasonbruck strictly regulated jails! Life span of animals in prisons is unnaturally short. No usda not anyone can unregulated that. Every enslaved animal there would choose their freedom instead. And they have right to be free to choose that. Some people play God and Devil and enslave these animals for money. Those are facts. The fact that the whole process is regulated, it doesn’t make it right. It is wrong to enslave for entertainment any life! It is and it will always be wrong.
Wow 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱

Animals are meant to b free and not to be used for the entertainment of ppl.
It's gonna flop everywere
Why is it in an aquarium? Disappointed that you would support the captivity of animals in small enclosures.
So cuteeee 😍
They should be livin free in the ocean, too bad ppl promoting this kind of shit.
Least he is taller then Kevin hart lol
Lovely

Ouuroo Becky ouuooroo😂
In awe of these creatures? Shame you support their exploitation and are happy to see them trapped in a tank to entertain humans. Educate yourself
Hey rock do u have a half brother
Cute pic rock
@ginjdaninj I hope so.  And thank you for actually making sense with your view , I'll always listen to others just not trolls
Go educate yourself on the detrimental effects that captivity has on these “regal” intelligent animals, then perhaps you’d stop promoting whales get imprisoned in marine parks.
@italianabella36 I can’t.......🤦🏼‍♀️
Respect 💯💯💯
so nice
Would look even better in the wild where they fuckin belong
I love how all these animal activists are just assuming that every animal in every aquarium, zoo, etc, are being tortured and beaten and starved, like seriously? Blackfish and the cove are your only sources? Documentary's and shows are your only sources? Are you retarded? Did you take any English class in highschool or college where they teach you about citing materials and valid sources? Not to mention, you should probably look up programs and restrictions (at least in the U.S.) that prohibit wild captures and tortures. I'm not saying there aren't zoos and aquariums that do that stuff but it's very rare that there are. Y'all are the ones who need some fucking education. If you disagree with me, I'll be happy to dm you and send several gov. Sites and official programs that prove you wrong. Because unlike y'all, I don't base most of my knowledge on documentaries, movies, and shows or take what other people have said and just believe them. Smfh

They belong in the ocean, not locked up in swimming pools and forced to do tricks! @therock you have the platform to make so much change. Please don’t support aquariums/marine parks!

@jasonbruck not complaining, just replying to your comment.
Cute
Wooooooo
@yinon_turm ינון הדולפין
@_taysimone so how many are saved,  Rehabilitated and released back into the wild? How many thousands belugas need help and how many are offered that help? What are the efforts of your "aquarium" to stop what happens at the pharoah islands every year?
@ardiefishall I made that pun on porpoise.
That is soo beautifulll
Who’s forehead is bigger
It's a beluga, not a human. They naturally look like they're smiling....try not to be to stupid.

If you were really in awe of these characters you would fight to keep them out of aquariums and in the ocean.

Such a beautiful creature in deed, you are very lucky @therock 😁😀👊🏻👏🏻👌🏻👍🏻😀
@kattalack195 the stupidity from some people must really hurt... damn how is it possible that people don’t know what is going on in this world? So much ignorance. Mankind is really doomed 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Yet its stuck in a aquarium? 🤦‍♀️
That is my favorite exhibit there!!!
Follow me, like for like
@sidijoker what has this to do with whales or Belugas and why are you attacking me with such a weird question? And from where do you get the idea that I have a boyfriend with a F-16 🙄🤣🤣. Maybe I am married, single, lesbian or whatever, so don't accuse or attack me without knowing me. Oh and by the way, to ease your mind, I am also very worried and concerned about all the poor kids in war zones, it breaks my heart.

@iamcindy.l I would prefer to live a shorter life if it meant that I could stay with my family, be happy, and do the things that come natural to me. Would you choose a life where you're ripped away from your loved ones without choice and then be placed in glass house eating when others told you to as long as you behaved how they wanted you to? I don't think so.

Very disappointed that you go see them in captivity. Empty the tanks . Your Samoan you know it would anger the gods. Shame

@7kieran beluga!!
@reverse_taye you ask me what have I done for animals... so no fast food!! Simple answer. The fast food industry is one of the big players in the world wenn it comes to animal cruelty. Watch #foodinc on you tube see for your self... has nothing to to with being a Samaritan but your being aware of what is going on on this world... but you reaction says it al to me...
Not a fan of dolphins or whales in captivity....
Rock - this fish definitely doesn't belong inside a tank
Wow!
Hahahahahahhaha
sooo sweet
What’s up with you and white animals lately?
I don't belive this,my friend was right, you are friend with everyone;)
In Awe of them? Then get them set free.

Nope, nope, nope . . .  These creatures belong in the ocean, not in some damn fake water tank that doesn't allow them to simply be who they are and swim and swim and swim.  Come on dude, this is sooo not cool.

From a big white gorilla to a big white fish? Mix it up a little Rock! But that would still be cool.
Also, just saw rampage and it was terrible. Good acting from yourself as always. You did your best with TM what you were working with. But nothing else good about the movie
Omg you're here in Ga??? I did the Beluga experience  earlier this year it was one of the most amazing things I've ever done! Did you get to touch the melon? Did you meet all 3 of them???? So exciting I hope you had fun.

@therock I’m so so SO SAD when I see this post. Please take a moment to look into what captivity means for these highly intelligent beings with complex family structures. Please do not support for-profit aquariums, sea parks such as Miami Seaquarium or SeaWorld. I know with your voice, so many people would be educated and aware and we as a community could make a different in the exploited lives of innocent creatures. They belong in the ocean. Please watch @blackfish_movie

@brycespeechley is this what you were talking about 😍 so beautiful!
😳 would any creature with staggering intelligence enjoy living in captivity? And doing all these stupid tricks for a fish?
So cool 😎🐳💪
U both looking same:)
@jasonbruck Im sorry... But you are wrong. Van Aqua has a Japanese dolphin that they aqcuired after it was injured in a dolphin drive. I'm certain that more than one of Marineland Can's dolphins also came from Japan. As to the rest of the North American Facilities... The dolphins currently in captivity are the offspring of drive caught dolphins if not drive dolphins themselves. Yes the majority are going to Asia and Russia now however That does not mean that we should let up pressure on the Taiji markets. There is little to no animal welfare regulatiins in China, they are even worse off there.
@therock fuck seaworld wyd

@kmh912 you do realize that these poor animals are stolen from their families and put into small cages for human entertainment. Nothing about this okay. Also most of the times the animals are abused and also animals in the wild live 2x longer than animals in captivity. Zoos and aquariums need to shutdown completely. Educate yourself please!!

Damnit @therock you can't go around punching whales just because you can. Challenge one to a fight for charity like the guy who boxed a kangaroo back in the day, or the guy that tried to wrestle the bear. Or my buddy who took a lion out to international waters and tried to fight it 1v1 bareknuckles. That was a bad day. But see what I mean Therock  you just shouldn't do it
Please watch Blackfish on Netflix. Zoos and aquariums steak animals from the wild away from their families and put them in small cages to entertain humans. Educate yourself please. Zoos and aquariums need to shutdown completely and animals need to go to conservation places!

Best pic ever
surely you know better than to support these incredible creatures being held in captivity??!!!!!
No no no
@_taysimone I rescue chickens who are destined for slaughter, so they don’t end up on a dinner plate. If I let them free range on my property, they may get eaten by a hawk or a fox, So I could keep them in their coop/run all day.... but I don’t. Because freedom is more powerful then safety.
@therock see you’re choosing to go in the absolute other direction 😂
@danieldore317 doesnt matter, they dont belong in a tank due to their size and them not being domesticated. If you don’t understand that i feel really bad for you
😃😃😃
Que  cosa mas bella...😍😍😍
Wauw 🙏🏻👌🏼💪🏼🤩
@_nicolewatson_ I understand that, I was simply stating that some animals in certain places are rescued.
@_taysimone this is exactly the info I was looking for. I knew someone on here would know if it were a rescue or a capture. Thanks for this.
U U dared to do that? Running...against?
FREE MY HOMIE FLIPPER.
@therock captivity kills. This beautiful animal belongs to nature, pleas don’t support this
@therock not cool. #disappointed
Awesome
@408.destiiny if that was case they would not be performing circus tricks for rotten food and be trapped in tiny tank which is far cry from miles of ocean they are meant to be in.
@kezghana.barnabe
@_taysimone  so this whale is performing on its own saw @therock and thought hey let me give him a hsnd shake. What bloody twaddle.
WoOw😜
No.. 😪
bay max : ba la la laa
@b1kes4l1fe you are racist
Holy shit! @friesonthefloor ... Remember my rock that looked like a beluga? Here's The Rock with a beluga! I can read into the future!
@j.lee.ausie.essex yes!!
Rampage 2..
Dude thinks you’re one of them with your bald, shiny ass head
❤️❤️❤️

Nice pic bhai
awesome
Very cool Photography , i Love this animals 💛💛
@rockerchick7777 yes. But do you want to have a long life in captivity where you can go nowhere (like if you’re in your house for you entire life), or do you prefer live a short life in total liberty ?

@missuscoco 🤐 shut up
Set it free fuckers 🙄🖕
Disappointed to see someone like you visiting animal prison camps subjected to forced labour!! They have been stolen from their families in the wild, and starved to perform for human greed and ignorance and drugged most of the time. Would you like that? Extremely disappointed!!!
Sweet
Are you twins ok im just kidding
..This is so cute.... The Rock 💪👌👍💪💪
Gorgeous
😍😍😍
These beautiful belugas should not be in captivity . Please do not believe the hype, they are not happy , no happiness ever comes from stolen freedom. They belong in the ocean where they can swim 100km a day not in an artificial environment. Please research capture and training, how they do not perform willingly but only due to food deprivation, food which is drug laced. As a celebrity please do not endorse cetacean captivity . You can check our website at www.wowvstaiji.com

Finally!! Someone who makes you look smaller. 💚
Wooooooo wht a brilliant capture 😍🤗
Wow... So 😎

@reverse_taye well first I don’t go to mc Donald’s or KFC or what ever. Second I try to buy and use less plastic as possible and third on almost every holiday I went I try to do something for the animals there. Last year in Bali for the dogs with the volcano Mount Agun erupting...!!! Thank you and now I will ask you the same question.... what have you done?

Sorry bro-not so cool"
what is this
I admire you as an actor. I love your movies. But this photo breaks my heart. How can you support captivity with a clear conscience. This angel of the ocean should live in freedom. He/she was not born to entertain us. 💙🐋🐬💙 #borntobefree #captivitykills
Comel
@massy.arias can you tell what's so dope about a captivated beluga in a way too small aquarium, tank or swimming pool? These animals belong in the ocean, their natural habitat.
❤❤
Demasiado inteligentes !!

Best ever
Just saw your new skyscraper movie amazing definitely would go and see it again 😁😁👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
Dissapointed in you @therock ... please do not support or promote these places where such beautiful creatures are held in captivity... #emptythetanks

Nooooo! Please don't support captivity, you have kids and you must know no one wants to have their babies stolen from them to perform on a show. Animals suffer too when their offspring is violently ripped away from them. Please don't support it.

Whales and dolphins, like all animals, should not be held captive! They should be free and in the wild. #ShameOnYouGeorgiaAquarium
Whales dont belong in an aquarium. They belong in the wild. Not cool. maybe watching blackfish will give u a better understanding

@tinaskindiva every dolphin, beluga or orca looks happy even when they are in pain, that's how they are born, with that smiley face, or have you ever seen a sad dolphin.
Yes they are! So do not support captivity... They should be free
Wow mashallah! Amazing 👌🏽

If you like these animals so much bro. Don’t support a business that keeps them trapped. They only perform cause they are scared of what will happen if they don’t. @therock
Yes they are beautiful but it's too bad theyre in a prison

Do you really think they belong in tanks..?
Please shut the fuck up with all these hippy bullshit save the animals comments, not every animal is bloody abused or beaten. Do your fucking research. I own a dog doesn't mean I beat him or lock him up in a tiny fucking cage. Stfu and grow up.
@therock Your voice and influence are powerful. Please take a page from the playbooks of your peers like #mattdamon, @leonardodicaprio @aplusk #ellendegeneres and educate and advocate rather than exploit. 💜

Beautiful animals with staggering intelligence shouldn’t be there for the amusement of a self indulgent selfie nor to be a co-star.  He belongs in a ocean, you’re shaking hand with him while he’s held captive in a bathtub.  Call a spade a spade.  Who will cash his check from your next movie if he’s your “costar?” Expected more from you @therock  Outside of this ignorant post love your positivity and have been a huge fan.  Hope you just need some education on this topic.  #resist ✊🏼 Don’t brother hate replies from ignorant trolls
@therock he’ll replace Kevin Hart lol
"Staggering intelligence", but trapped in a concrete pool. Smh, get a clue !

Fucking bullshit. Those animals don’t belong in a aquarium. Those animals aren’t for entertainment! When do people understand? And keep your bullshit stories with you about rescues.  This isn’t an animal who you teach some tricks. A big No No @therock
Awe 💙💙💙
Awesome
You guys look alike...😜
@nikkohurtado such a cutie

So sad that you support captivity of these beautiful intelligent creatures.  They did not ask to be held against their will in captivity, no freedom to swim as they’d wish.....
So beautiful

I hope one day I can see them in the wild. Challenge is I can't dive because of my condition with my ears. But just seeing them jump through the ocean would be so cool. # bucketlist#balugalove#therockrocks

@alex_and_malak we may want to consider to start freeing all our pets like cats and dogs as well. They’re in captivity in our homes. They may be better out there in the wild with the coyotes and wolves! That’s what they come from anyway.
So cute...😋😋😋

I wanted to be able to do that every since I was a child and didn't get to until I was already a grownup, but THE HAPPIEST WOMAN IN THE WORLD JUST TO HAVE GOTTEN THE CHANCE, that's for sure!!
Wow
Not cool @therock . Please research what captive marine life has to suffer through to be apart of these “aquariums”
That animale is beautiful. Never seen one before.
Lucuk banget yatuhan... 😍
I really hope this is a sneak peak into Rampage 2.

Animals in captivity is cruel! This is not entertainment! Set an example and stop promoting animal exploitation!!
Can you believe the rock punched this harmless animal?

@therock I love what you stand for man but zoos and aquariums are basically prisons for animals. Animal exploitation is cruel and a man of your status could use his influence to teach millions of people why we should all reconsider caging wild animals for our amusement. Instead, millions of people are going to line up to high five a captive beluga whale now. Check out the work @peta is doing to see first hand what these majestic creatures endure in captivity. You’re an inspiration to all, keep teaching people how to be better brother. 👊🏻
Wow
Hello my friends ! For those that have time and care, can you please check out my page and give me feedback as I am a 15 year old artist trying to follow his dreams💯🙇. I would really appreciate it! Much love!! 💯
2 beautiful creatures
Super
@jennawesmiller we just missed the rock omg 😭
Dupar
@therock no species on this planet is happy when they are taken/ stolen away from home. From family. From the love that brought them into this world. Your a good man. Please make sure your co-star is happy. Thank you.
That nigga rockin no pun btw, he also white doe
Kevin could hug this creature🤣🤣🤣
@alex_and_malak well said. You’d think @therock would know better but then again he did do milk ads and took pics what crocs. Man’s all about money. Guy with his status and following should be making a difference in the world. Could probably save the world too. He should start having some real discussions with @leonardodicaprio and @venuswilliams about changing this world.

Heart broken to see you supporting these aquariums with wild mammals who deserve to be free & not destroyed in a prison. You should watch the black fish on the torture, cruelty in these soul crushing small inclouseures they endure @therock
Hell yea @georgiaaquarium
@amyleegambow
👏👏👏😍😍😍😍
Wow!!! So cool!
If you truly loved these animals, you would never "play" with them in an aquarium. Poor animals...
You are just too funny !!!
Smart look @therock
Cool
Oh, man! Please look into this and consider taking a stand - this and all the ocean issues could use an advocate such as yourself. Check out @oceanicpreservationsociety @racingextinction ... lots of good info out there on the problem surrounding sea mammals in captivity. Thank you!
They are actually pretty tasty as well. I prefer the skin but I heard steaks are pretty good #inuk

@thecr0wn_ these places are the only way for 90% of people to see this marine life. People want to see belugas and aquariums like this are actually affordable to get into. The tours to see them in the wild are controlled by the rich and the powerful who hike prices costing a working class family a small fortune
So Beautiful😍

Respect. I support good zoos and aquariums. They do fantastic work. Unfortunately, most people watch a slanted documentary and become overnight "experts" on a vast field of study. Keep up the good work @therock
Found something bigger than you lol 😂😂😂
Woooow!!😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
It should be in freedom and not in an Aquarium 😔
You know you're huge when you look bigger than a whale!

Please let them be free of captivity. They should be in the wild not cooped up in a small fish tank. Perhaps you could help with your celebrity status and allow them to be free as they should be.

It's time for a Flipper remake featuring @therock and @kevinhart4real 😂😂😂
@thesurfandturfsanctuary none omg what you said was true. And I have a Doctorate in this. So I’m very well educated thank you. That’s why I know you aren’t being honest. The USDA under APHIS has strict animal welfare protocols that directly follow the guidelines of the AWA. Frequently the public is even allowed to weigh in on APHIS mandates. So you are free to put in your two sense if there is something you don’t like. And as far as USDA research, that Work feeds a lot of people...even vegans. So let’s not cast aspersions. With the exception of Russia, Asia and whaling nations in Europe animals are not taken from the wild. In North America no healthy animal has been taken in decades. Check cetabase.org to verify.
Is this real or Hollywood/photoshop...?
👌👌💗
Jealous!! Beluga whales are my favorite animal ever 😍

They should be in the wild and no one has the right to touch them!

@ferbrido qué envidia 😔
@_taysimone Basically you are describing "Beluga Paradise", sounds like, for the well sake of the species, all belugas should be living at GA.

@alex_and_malak no if the animal needs to be RESCUED/SAVED would u rather it die or it be nursed back to health a lot of times these animals are released back sometimes they are either too sick or won’t survive putting them back in the wild idk about u I rather see these amazing creatures alive rather than dead
@_mermadd
Nice
@therock I never comment on posts but I’m so sad to see this Rock - you are a beautiful soul, don’t condone aquariums and this Beluga with its intelligence deserves freedom and the open oceans.

Don’t ruin the Rock for me 😭. Don’t be captivated by captivity.  Research that aquarium research Beluga captivity.
Please be aware a lot of whales and orcas are forcibly taken from the wild and drugged and starved  to perform. Plus captivity brings about a lot of physical, mental, medical and social problems not encountered in the wild. #stoptaiji #banwhalecaptivity #bandolphinshows #banaquariums

Then you picked it up & squatted it? 😂

Staggering intelligence ?ok Brada I’m going to look them up
@nate_del23 omgggg so cuteee
Dumbest post I have seen all day. Probs smarter than this man who calls himself "the rock".... maybe if the tanned whale swapped places with the white whale this earth would be a tiny bit better off.

Marine Mammals should be free in the wild, not in a tank. Sad.

Beluga are my fav! I got to see one up close at Seaworld last year. Best experience. Wish I could have been as close as you! God is amazing with his creations!
Lovely
@alex_and_malak thank you! Multiple Belugas have died in captivity at the Georgia Aquarium. I love the Rock, but these animals deserve to be free.
@therock I really hope you take the time to reflect on the negative comments attached to this photo - someone in your position with such a massive social following should not be promoting this cruelty. These animals are subjected to so much horror and pain - educate yourself on this industry. You could make such a difference.

@jasonbruck Captivity is wrong period. They are bred, stolen and ripped from their families. I’m sorry you are #captivatedbycaptivity the USDA does very little to enforce the AWA they also support & financially fund lab animals & that’s just the beginning....please #educateyourself

@alex_and_malak it’s called positive reinforcement training. Read Karen Pryor. It’s not a secret. Animals aren’t abused. You have wrong notions about what goes on here.
@alex_and_malak most aquariums are rehab and also work with repopulating a particular species. Aquariums, not fucking sea world.

@sarah.ann27 what lifespan data are you citing? And while I am not a fan of wild captures, if those Belugas weren’t going to be released they would have been better of in Georgia than where they are now.
Smiles in both of you handsome creatures!!
Dear @therock, I would pay to see this underwater Atlantis buddy cop film. The Beluga Whale would be voiced by @kevinhart4real. Please make it happen. The world needs the Adventures of Action Rock Merman. 👍👍👍

Cute
Oohing just came back from there
Awesome
Wow very
Love this pic! I had to do a report in 4th grade on this whale! 😊
@gabrielhrebien our boy!!! 💕😊
Great!!!
It's just a shame the humans that put it in jail are not as intelligent and beautiful as it is. They belong in the wild. If the animal has a disability, is sick or was injured by poachers, then maybe an exception can be made. But thats not how these animals end up in these places. Most of the time aquariums and Zoos buy these animals and people capture them from the wild. So they are removed from their natural habitat where their families are and are torn away from them. Yes people may come on here and say to me "prove it", but i say this: can the aquariums or zoos prove otherwise? They must prove people like me wrong. And by the way Rock, i raise my eyebrow. We need people with your kind of influence to push the correct message out to people. No one listens to politicians or cops, but they listen to people like you. Can you smell what I'm cooking?
Well-done bro
JRB was here in Taipei; I worked very hard to get to know You and Kevin Hart !!! Let’s catch up next time you in Taipei !

Not cool @therock.

Right on! 👊

This animals is not for fun @therock I hope you understand
@obie__1 he’s your perfect man 😍
The Rock is having a whale of a time.
喜欢
@alex_and_malak The beluga isn't doing a tricks. Belugas don't do tricks at the Aquarium. He's showing an adapted behavior that is used when he needs to be given medical tests. The Rock's photo is from an area of the aquarium not open to the public. The whale was likely being fed or examined during that part of the tour and exhibited behaviors that he has adapted to use around humans.

@_taysimone I was wrong about the number in the past eight years. It was an eight year time span in the early 2000’s. My fault. Moving on. Do you not think part of the issue with the captive bred fatalities has to do with the mental health of the mothers and the breeding program in general? And I agree with the above comment about the interaction program... there are better ways of making money.

@popski625 These creatures are taken from the wild and confined in pens that are too small and offer no stimulation. This is not there natural habitat! They’re trained to entertain humans (as this one is, as he shakes the hand of @therock), doing activities that aren’t natural for them. What about that is good?

"@ancusator I work at a facility that takes in rescues that have been deemed not releasable due to injury or stranded at such a young age they could not safely be rereleased. 
They call natural lagoons in the Gulf of Mexico home, & have a staff of humans that bend over backwards to ensure they have the best care possible. 🙌🏼"
@euniceeeli yes i saw it
Its looks like @KurtAngle
@_taysimone then leave it for the vets. I find this information not accurate . As an animals activist we are well aware of the GA aquariums and you guys have had several reports . Any aquarium or zoo that offers “interactions” with the animals does not have the animals best interest at heart. A true “sanctuary “ and rescue place make sure the animals live the closest to their natural habitat therefor keeping interaction between humans and them limited. GA offers people to get up close and personal with some of the creatures and help “train” them. The animals are then exposed to humans of all backgrounds.  Just like any animal / human , we don’t always want to be in company however as humans we are able to speak of what we wish. I think it’s great that you love your job and love your aquarium .. and it’s just a matter of opinion and moral compass . I don’t think any animal should be captive . Except those who have acted as domestic animals for century’s so they no longer obtain the “wild” genes they once had . I believe , they should be rescued if they need . And if they can’t be released live their life as close as they can to natural habitat . Away from peering eye. Flashing cameras small tanks and “tricks” or training. There are plenty of programs who do what you are saying is done without the general public having access to them. But continue to do what you do . And as long as their are people like you who have a passion to help . Then hopefully the animals in your care won’t be another number failed by humans x

@sm00thdaddy In order to make a beluga whale do tricks is by abusing the animal physically and especially mentally. Many end up dying from depression and isolation. Whales/dolphins belong in their natural habitat not in a tiny pool.

@sarah.ann27 fist off beluga mortality rate is 50-50 that’s in human care and in the wild and only has to do with babies not mature belugas and that’s because young belugas in general have a hard 1st year of life and most don’t make it. Second the GA aquarium never had 6 belugas in the past 8 years so that’s not factual at all.
I ❤ dolphins.

That "beautiful animal with staggering intelligence" does not belong in captivity. The longer people continue to support and promote animals in captivity the longer they will suffer. Maybe you could advocate for their freedom rather than their imprisonment which simply deprives them of their freedom and natural life.
That beautiful creature belongs in the ocean. I love you, but I seriously hate this post. #heartbroken💔

Omg!😱 love that picture. Belugas are amazing animals.
@_taysimone so the mortality rate of belugas born into captivity isn’t about 65%? And y’all haven’t lost six belugas in the past eight years? I am not arguing that they do not have serious obstacles in the wild but we should be working to improve those conditions before resorting to captivity. Especially when the supposed reason is that children in North America won’t be able to see a live beluga accept in “pictures or on a digital screen.”
Love this!!!

But today POLICE AND PEOPLE OF CHATRO LEAGUE tortured students with tear shell. They are beating students brutally and raping the female students. The students are trying to defend themselves with sticks and tree branches that they've found on the streets.

4 students have been murdered and other 4 female students have been raped and are still held captive inside a building which is being guarded by 100+ police. Many more have been injured severly. And the Government is sitting there silent.

@caferguson Wow! That is so cool!

@alex_and_malak The GA Aquarium actually acquire animals that were held in horrible conditions (not the wild). The first belugas at the aquarium were actually rescued from being held in a pool under a roller coaster. They could not have possibly survived in the wild. The animals were transferred to the Aquarium to allow them to get stronger and to study them in a effort to preserve whales in the wild. The Georgia Aquarium operates as a non profit with proceeds going towards conservation and the study of marine biology. It is very different from a Sea World.

This is seriously concerning. This animal should no be in the Georgia aquarium. This is horrible. Please retract this.
@gabbm100
@jasonbruck Yeah that's what they'd prefer lmao..to be spoiled in a concrete tank the size of a bathtub for the rest of their lives.. get your head out of your ass. @therock should know better but maybe it's the fame that has his head in the clouds where he'd promote stupidity like this...regulated by the USDA like that means jack shit. I still think they'd rather live free in a sea of  plastic than be captive and used for the entertainment of people like you. @richardobarry @dolphin_project wouldn't you guys agree?
Thank you so much for embracing them! Means the world ☺️❤️🌍
Lame, be an advocate not an exploiter. @therock-do better.
@danieldore317 well do some research on proven habits of dogs and cats when they build strong relationships with you, I’d suggest. Not every pet can love you but mostly, they do (of course because you care for them. Thats why they love you)
He can hang out with George in Rampage 2 lol
@northshorexplorer their habitat is not some small fish bowl, what you guys see is not even half of their habitat, you guys only see one window, but if you saw it from the top of the habitat behind the scenes, you’d see how vast their habitat really is.

@shatzlerxxmckenzie sigh. Wild beluga life expectancy is 10 to 15 years (Braham, 1984; Burns and Seaman, 1986; Beland et al., 1988; Doidge, 1990; Lessage and Kingsley, 1998). Captive beluga life expectancy is 32.8 years (Innes, et. all 2005). So no, that is not what the "professionals" told me, I have just taken the time to "track and research". If you have conflicting peer reviewed studies in mind, I would love to see them. Please don't insult my intelligence just because my opinion differs from yours.

Cool pic
"@j.lee.ausie.essex the belugas at the GA aquarium don’t perform tricks, there isn’t a beluga show, what you see in the picture is an interaction behavior taught to the belugas by trainers so that check up appointments with vets go smoothly, if they need to draw blood to make sure the belugas are healthy and happy, which they are, they teach them how to hold out a fin

And most times animals that are rescued are released back into the wild and the animals at the aquarium are never there their entire life, however some animals that are rescued are deemed non releasable by conservationists way about the aquarium due to them being injured in the wild or being abandoned at a young age and never developed the skills to survive in the wild, it happens and those animals have a home at the aquarium where they can live happy lives"

If more humans TRULY cared about animals, and less about their experience with the animal...This wouldn't exist to the extent it does. You and all other celebrities have a voice in the world, don't be a voice that condones this. Suffering is suffering. Animal or human.
Big dad wow
Cruel not cute sorry
Why??? Why are you supporting this? Animals are not ours to cage for our entertainment. #emptythetanks
To the people saying set the animal free, there are a few problems. One they would be killed, two you have no real knowledge of this exact animal, there is a chance is can't be freed do to a medical problem, and lastly, you have no idea how that aquarium actually treats the animals. In Oklahoma at a animal "zoo" the help the animals get better and take care of the ones that can't make it on their own, yet animal "rights" activist poisoned animals. Let you judgement be educated, don't just follow the trend.

@northshorexplorer I highly doubt they would choose starving to death over eating 5 meals a day without having to lift a fin.

@thesurfandturfsanctuary the animals are safe and regulated by the USDA. The real concern is the plight of the Saint Lawrence Belugas. So infected with toxic waste that when they wash up the carcass as to be removed by people in hazmat suits. This whale is cared for by trainers who spoil her daily.

I'm incredibly disappointed that you would support keeping whales in captivity and particularly this facility that recently tried to import kidnapped beluga whales to the aquarium from Russia! Watch the films Blackfish and The Cove to fully educate yourself on this barbaric animal cruelty. Animals aren't ours to use as entertainment, they are not willing performers but are forced to perform. 💔🐳
Wowowo
@jasonbruck It is well known Belugas do not do well in captivity and live longer lives in the wild. The Georgia aquarium was trying to import wild caught belugas from Russia just a few years ago. They are not all captive bred and the ones who are, often are done under circumstances that wildly go against nature and end in death more often than not.
Hahaha Rampage 2 with albino whale
A Beluga!!!
Beautiful 💙💙💙
Nice
@jessigwbffpro
@amaffris @magtotos I was just talking about the Georgia Aquarium! Belugas are awesome!
@e.saruultugs beluga whale bro. 😆
👌👌👌👌
Set them free dude.
@therock they are magnificent creatures but they only belong in the wild. Captivity kills. Please don’t think I don’t adore you but wanted you to know as a person who fights for their freedom along with the rest in captivity. #pleasehelpandraiseawarness, #beavoice,#endcaptivity #emptythetanks

Awesome
@nguyenrochelle us

Damn I guess my dad is right, everyone loves the rock
Shame it's in a tank
@funkinwityou ......
Great place! Beautiful Whale!
Don’t support Sea World or any other animal prison!
Basically
Buy her and set her Free in ocean
@andy.saunders1 🤦‍♂️
Disappointed to see you support such aquariums... #dontbecaptivatedbycaptivity #emptythetanks

@greatness440 these ones are. It is illegal to release captive born cetaceans. And sea pens are disease vectors. This animal is regulated by the USDA. It’s fine.
These animals belong in the ocean, Rock.
Joss Rock
@therock ..this means you’re doing a remake of ‘Powder’? Love that movie! Hahaa
@hhbethh thank you 😊
@beezyfpickles he’s not even hating on anyone he’s just stating facts. Obviously you’re just another sensitive fan
Captivity kills! For these imprisoned animals, their intelligence is a curse not a blessing! They understand that they are trapped and it kills them slowly. Please don't support this.
@micaela_perry let’s go hang out with him
I've been there #georgiaaquarium
@meganjessen
hahaha love
@just_joshn_yah
@ijustine no it's not. This animal should be free in the wild not being toyed with by a movie star
Wow 😍
Fantastic
He makes ya look kinda normal sized 😱🙃
😍😍😍
Oh. .... no super..
Whoa! What a lovely pic!

@indominus16extinction dolphins' mouths are naturally curved. Always looks like they're smiling even when they're suffering.

I love the Rock but this is SO disappointing. He should NOT be promoting animal abuse and cruelty! Let this creature free!😩😥
Greatest handshake in a history 😱
But you are sooo much cutier 😍😍😍😍
Beluga whales are my favorite ❤️❤️❤️
But its possible for human beings to know about life style of nature things
👏👏👏👏👏😍😍😍😍😍
Really disappointed to see your support for captive animals @therock . I love all that you do and promote otherwise, but I can't see past this - you're such a great icon to people all over the world (myself included) please use your platform to help teach people the cruel reality of captive animals. It has been brushed under the carpet for far too long and we as humans need to restore our love, kindness and gratitude to the natural world and the incredible life we share it with💚🙏🏼🌏
I'm so disappointed 😢 #emptythetanks #captivitykills
@kevin_waddell_venom_ it’s really not. And yet you are an animal educator and trainer.. ironic
@dolas_dreams ❤️❤️
I wish there was a way to dislike this picture.
If you're so in awe of this creature, why are you ok hanging out with it while it's held captive? For this intelligent animal to shake your hand it needed to be trained to do so. Do you know what these animals go through to be trained? #animalabuse
@ashleynocera no it's not😷
Hermoso!!!

I admire you as an actor. I love your movies. But this photo breaks my heart. How can you support captivity with a clear conscience. This angel of the ocean should live in freedom. He/she was not born to entertain us. 💙🐋🐬💙 #captivitykills.
What movie
He’s sizing you up 🐬💪🏼🤣
So cute wow
Captivity killing these beautiful creatures
@gi_dup OH MY GOSH!!!!!! 😭😭😭😭

@kevinhart4real I was waiting for your comment 🤭🤣😂
Hmmm
Es Albino?
@alex_and_malak u realize most of the animals in captivity are rescues and if not they are breed in captivity most people would never get to enjoy these beautiful creatures. and does that beluga look depressed?
Uouuuuuu💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
@jarod_eddy
@framey1995 it’s me
Do ur best to free these captive animals if u can ya @therock

Animals in captivity is a horrible thing and should never be condoned or promoted

@_taysimone I think many of these animals would choose death vs a life of captive Hell
wow ..owesome👏😱👍
@rockerchick7777 is that what the "professionals"told you? Heard the same thing from Sea World for years. No one believing that would take the time and actually track or research first hand to find out.
This is disappointing 😢
amazing
@allyycatt23  I feel like this picture has everything you love 😂

@alex_and_malak lmao belguas live much longer in captivity than in a wild setting....and according to multiple animal welfare orginizations that monitor this institution they are not "beat and abused"

Hi Dwaine, I follow you because I like  your values, and you seems really to be a good good person but please your an example for many people, and this kind of park is not good thing for the animals. This beautyfull beluga lives in a pool like a lion in cage from the circus only for the pleasure of the humans. It's sad. Sorry for my English (I'm French😉) many good things for you dude
You beatifull
@mommallee @valpack87 😍
Oooh! ♥️
Not your best photo @therock - the Belugas, like most captive marine mammals are held captive against their own will...... they are not here for our entertainment. That’s your job to entertain and be an actor- a lifestyle you willingly chose.
Very sad 😢 poor animal @therock
👍
I was just there 2 weeks ago. Beautiful creature indeed

Good
That’s scary as hell
@alex_and_malak so high and mighty you are. You don’t have an ounce of humility in your soul. You’re bragging about saving the world while hating on someone else who also does a lot of good. That is disgusting to me.
sucks that an animal like this can’t live life in the ocean with others and live life happily , instead it lives in a small tank learning tricks
@angela_leonidas this is awesome
@lilbugsntroy  omg
💔💕
Thank you for supporting @georgiaaquarium - their outstanding standard of animal welfare and dedication to conservation are top notch and more important now than ever. Glad you had a great time learning about beautiful belugas! @therock
❤️❤️❤️
@mrs.mchone I know!! Think i tagged wrong Sawyer if u wanna forward lol
Poor animal, I hope you do something to get him back to the ocean. You have money and fame to do it.
@sweat.eat.travel.live yeah whatever.
@agmclellan  didn't know you met theRock recently.

I have always wanted to do that in life its so cool

@therock Supporting placing or keeping an intelligent animal in captivity is beyond cruel. You should be intelligent enough to know how wrong and unfair life in a tank is 💔

"America’s Insistence That Africans Must Wear Used Clothes.  By Owei Lakemfa.

Rwanda is a small landlocked African country with a 26,338  square kilometer, a population of 11.9 million and a GDP of $8.9 Billion. It is with this country, the United States (US) the world’s largest economy with a $20.412 Trillion GDP, a 9,147,420 square kilometre and a population of 326,920,253, has picked a trade war.
Yet this trade war tiny Rwanda is fighting, is on behalf of  Africa following US  insistence that Africans must wear clothes already used by Americans . 
The steps that led to the war began in March 2016 when the  Heads of State of  Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan who constitute the East African Community (EAC) decided to ban the importation  of used clothes by 2019 as part of the EAC Vision 2050. They sought to grow  the  manufacturing sector from  8.7 percent to  25 percent by 2032.
They also agreed  to increase  import duties on used clothing to discourage its  use and promote local production. As part of this decision, Uganda for example  increased the environmental levy on used clothes from 15 percent  to 20 percent  while Rwanda  increased the import duty on used American clothes from $0.25 to $2.50 per kilogram. Tanzania increased  its own  tariffs from 0.2 to 0.4 US dollars per kilogram.  The US was  livid; how can Africans decide to shun clothes discarded by Americans? If Africans, regarded as the poor of the earth would not buy used American clothes, who will?  How will American second hand clothe traders unionized under  the Secondary Materials and Recycled Textiles Association (SMART) continue in business? 
In 2017, it  sent a warning  to the African countries to either accept the used American clothes, or be punished. But the African countries refused to be intimidated.  President Kagame in response to the American threats, said in 2017: ""This is the choice we find that we have to make. As far as I am concerned, making the choice is simple, we might suffer consequences. Even when confronted with difficult choices, there is always a way,"" Uganda's Minister for Finance, Planning and Economic Development, Matia Kasaija decla"

All you haters on here need a life. You don't really know this animal's circumstance. All of you just want to jump on the politically PC train. @therock philanthropy is felt all over the world.  He is the change you wish to see in the world. Go back to hugging your trees and playing dungeons and dragons.

The Rock is awesome like is Beluga  whale
Love your work @therock but cannot support captive intelligent species trained to do circus tricks for food. Their value to our ecosystem and level of emotional intelligence goes far beyond our human lack of concious and using these animals to make money for entertainment. Many beluga's especially face depression & psychosis swimming months & years in the same tank in circles. This is not an ocean life they are built for. #emptythetanks 🙏💕

Lol that's hilarious! Same hairstyle too!
I love baluga whales #babybaluga
What a beautiful species.
😍 @jyechevy
@kmh912 what is wrong with you?? Anyone interested in education and conservation would know that captivity like this is wrong and abusive.
Y’all crying about how these animals are in captivity when you don’t even know the facts... 🤨newsflash, watching blackfish does not give you everything you need to know. #geteducated

@itzjus4fun

What a beautiful animal, to bad it’s in a tank and not where it belongs - why would you support this terrible practice?
:(
:(
Matching hair do’s.
@therock Is this the one in Atlanta? If so, I’ve been there and it’s awesome
@kevin_waddell_venom_ oh get over yourself mate, if you are proud to support such cruelty go ahead but it’s so very wrong and you cannot justify it in this day and age.
richardoberry
The Georgia Aquarium is awesome!
They are my favorite animal to see in the aquarium! I live in Atlanta and I try to go as often as I can! You can't just go once
@marseille_lucas not even worth debating with you
@louielove_ because you wouldn’t be whining like a kitten baby if you knew why there is aquariums. Think about the memories people make at places like this. For almost everyone in the world this is the only way they’ll ever see animals like this. Including the Rock! Ain’t no telling the memories he and hjs family made

Looks like he punched it and send it flying back
Awwww love him

@ct_trismegistus so it's not a rescue
That is adorable. Sea creatures need love and protection. Without them we are one step closer to being alone.
I just love this post. Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful experience!

I have been a huge fan since the beginning, however, can you please research where these whales and dolphins came from? You are an intelligent man and I'm sure you realize how wrong this is! Check out @dolphin_project or @seashepherd and use your celebrity for something amazing!!
This is heartbreaking to see

Cool !!
@therock make it about releasing him and all his friends
Beluga whales are my favorite!

Omg super cute 💓💓💓💓
@jamesemulate your wrong again idiot. You don’t know me. I’ve rescued thousands of innocent animals over the years across the globe from captivity to circuses and isolated areas. It’s our duty to fight for what’s right. You can keep on disrespecting us but we have thousands of supporters around the world including the Wwf. I hope one day you wake up and realize what the rock is doing is wrong. Take care
The beluga whale has been my favorite animal since I was a kid. They're magical, hopefully I'll get to encounter them like this one day 😍
@therock I think you would do great in a remake of dolphin tale!
Ah stop adorable

Not only do you make humans smile with just your presence you also make Beluga Whales smile. God bless you 👏🏾
Why does this look like @therock is about to rip that whales fun off?!?!
@chris_mitchell16 why do you assume that I don’t know “the facts” as you call them. I know a whole lot more that you obviously think I do. Don’t look silly by making accusations until YOU know the facts
Why does it look like you’re about to give the whale a rock bottom? 🤘
So beautiful photo  dolphins

WHY THE ROCK GOTTA GO TO THE GEORGIA AQUARIUM WHEN IM NOT THERE 😤
Great
@thesurfandturfsanctuary sorry the rock @therock ily but the people are correct. Stop stigmatizing these animals. Love everything you do, but your all about thinking ahead and thinking humanely, think about them..
What is your next movie

@therock vs stone cold lol
What's wrong with this picture? Simple...the animal is in a tank!!!!!
Oh ffs. Here come all the know-it-alls preaching about animal cruelty while completely ignoring the fact that millions of marine animals who would otherwise be dead are instead RESCUED every year or the fact that many of those rescues CAN'T be released back into the wild because their of injuries. Just because SOME animals are abused, that doesn't mean every single one is. That type of narrow minded, hate mongering thinking only puts more animals at risk because you geniuses blindly attack the only organizations that are trying to help them. Do some actual, unbiased, research into the topic and actually get out there and volunteer with rescue organizations if you actually want to make a difference. Sitting on your ass at home being an armchair warrior and complaining on celebrities' social media pages isn't doing a damn thing to help.
😘
Cutest things

@popski625 that’s pretty darn silly. Dogs have been domesticated for thousands of years - not wales. And my dog chooses what he wears on his own

Please do NOT support this type of cruel human entertainment. Humans can entertain each other as you have entertained us for so so many years with wrestling and movies. These beautiful and intelligent animals are ripped away from their families and put in concrete bathtubs. This heartless human behavior is covered up by stating “conservation efforts” #captivitykills 👎🏼

You might not have time to read this and I understand. I'm such a huge fan I love all of your movies I just watched Rampage for the third time. Walking Tall is probably one of the dopest movies ever Central Intelligence was fucking awesome. I just wanted to let you know that I love your movies bruh
Waiting on @kevinhart4real to say something slick 👀👀👀
💌
Didn’t think you would be about animals in captivity. Really thought you were a great human. I’m very disappointed in you. People look up to you.  You should be helping animals get out of captivity.  Anyways i hope you read this, and i hope you do the right thing. I’ve went and paid to see animals in captivity before too. I’ve made the same mistake. I can now see how selfish i was at that moment.
😘😘😘😘😘😘cute
@therock you are beautiful and intelligent too, how would you cope with a life in captivity.
I'm confused, some people are saying that it shouldn't be kept in captivity but in the ocean it's polluted and there's poachers whereas in captivity it's given food and exercise
😍❤❤❤❤
@mange_kopa 😂😂 good joke
@prosser.elizabeth you talk about creatures being exploited by man to make money.  I am sure you feel the same about the treatment of horses because I know farms and stables are their natural habitat #nodifference
Kdk
Nice
Cool
Cool
@therock you and @eminem making a new movie?
Dear god that is amazbolls🎸🎸🎸🎸
Brilint rock
@therock Dude i am a huge fan but this picture promotes capitivity of these beautiful creatures. if they do not jump stick out their fins play with crowds like this they get litarally beaten and tortured. They are also drugged with heavey drugs to keep them in line suck has different opiods... regardless of how much the aquarium paid u... maybe use that money to have private investigators to see what really goes on... If you think this creature is that magificent please look  into the treatment capturing, training and how this also affects the rest of pods etc.. most importantly on jow this affects the animal itself.
Beluga wale

Being a huge star like you will be suuuuper awesome for human, i don’t doubt that. Yet for animals, i’m pretty sure they dont wanna. As they are in prison instead of in the nature.

Nice
Love you rock but aquariums with these kind of animals should not be. The travel for 1000 of miles and now the stuck in a bath. Cool picture but they should be free
I’m sure they’re in awe of you as well, both spectacular 😉👍🏻
What a surreal pic! Beluga is thinking "Holyshit, can't believe I'm meeting The Rock"!!! @therock
Flipper? @therock

love it..
@milfywaysky I’m not making any excuses for them and I never will make excuses for them. I already said I did not want to argue about this
Awesome photo bro
Wowww!! What even is your life these days haha I’m so jealous @therock 🙈❤️
@therock oh no, I really hope this is a conservation aquarium?! If not, PLEASE do your research into animal captivity. Everyone loves you so much- you could help make a difference to animals’ lives not exploit them!

Should an animal with staggering intelligence be in captivity for our entertainment? So sad to see this picture of you @therock #captivityiscruel #captivitykills
@kmh912 Thank you!  There are many species that would be extinct without the aid of zoos and aquariums. The virtue signaling, recreational outrage crowd is too concerned with being hip to understand that things are not black and white.🙌

@jamesemulate oh yea and what difference is that ? Explain. And you don’t shit about us. We actually go out there and make a difference around the world and fight for the ones in need. What does the rock do besides posting crap of himself just so he can gain more  audiences like you. So back to your thumb sucking and stfu.
😘😘😘😘😘
nice
@zookeeperjawnie I am not going to spam linking sources. Google is there and it’s free. Youtube as well, to see horror things. The moment a zoo mixes animals which should be free in their habitat with animals that are becoming extinct, and making money out of that, that is a bad zoo. And that is happening everywhere. If animals are becoming extinct are because of US! And zoos, from my point of view, are not the answer. But again,  we can be here forever...and it is not my plan for today. At least you were not disrespecful as others. Have a nice day!
@jj_smai yes! Imma be a movie star

@therock amazing picture brother Xx 🏋🏻‍♀️💪🏻👊🏻👍🏻
@alex_and_malak I completely agree with not exploiting animals for gain but some animals are living longer because of conservation efforts such as ‘rescues.’ BUT...I guess we will never know unless we know the true story of this beautiful whale.
He’s at my favorite aquarium with my favorite animal there! 😍 @sonia_3d @verypunnyhoney
Yeah 💪😘
@wwesheamus ?🤔
Guess who was at the aquarium @youneedastylist
Niceee rock

For the love of animal Rock please save this beautiful creature. I am not hating on you I am reaching out to you as a voice for this beautiful animal to give them the life they deserve ...happiness and love.
@kellymarcc look it’s your favorite whale!!
@ancanaca you know Panama City tiene con delfines and sea lions !
@nousernameformethanks  western theme parks haven’t taken animals from the wild in well over 20 years .  Many theme parks only hold sick and injured or endangered. If they can’t be released they stay in the park . In an ideal world everything would be wild but humans stuffed that up .
I really saw you in skyscraper skyscraper movie was so awesome
😍😍😍😍😍que lindo oooo
Omg I use to watch videos all about beluga whales they r so awesome and same with seal I live marine life

@emlwilliams woah this pictures awesome
@alex_and_malak I’m going to look it up, I didn’t know about that I rarely watch his films just read about his track record with individual charities. Ugh how infuriating when he could use his platform for so much good. Thanks for letting me know!
Wow

😥 how sad that someone with such a big platform wouldn’t try to bring awareness to animal cruelty and the abuse captivity causes. You should be out in their natural habitat to truly experience how intelligent they are

@alex_and_malak then why are you following him??
pls do not play with dolphin，they should live in sea，they are very unhappy and upset，some even commit suicide bcs they struggle every day！ dolphin can only smile...
@cady_chilensky WTF CADY YOU GOT A PIC WITH THE ROCK AND DIDNT TELL ME?????????!!!!!!!
Oh lawd I love them! This is definitely on my bucket list along with spending the day with an elephant.
No please @therock watch the documentary “born to be free” please don’t support aquariums, these animals are not happy and do not deserve to be used for humans entertainment and curiosity. You are better than this.
@kcyt ❣❣❣❣❣❣ tu me manques bb
@alex_and_malak on the contrary, some are actually RESCUED! As in; they’re found with severe injuries, taken to a rehab facility, of which you would love if you actually watched what they do, and determined to not be able to survive for very long if sent back to the wild. Sometimes it’s best to keep them and give them a chance to reproduce to keep the species thriving.
😍😍😍😍😍

@caiquejjx beluga
🤗
Disappointed is the word, dont support these😢😢😢
@kevin_waddell_venom_ So where do the Marine parks that don’t support that get their animals from? I’m not able to differentiate the good from the bad ones because it’s all part of the same problematic industry.
🔝🔝🔝
ever since watching black fish I have never looked at aquariums the same. hope these animals are well looked after #blackfish
Do you think he knew he was meeting the rock? Like he goes back to all his buddy’s like “dude guess what? I met the rock at work today” BEST. DAY. EVER!
A beautiful animal with staggering intelligence that does not belong in a tank.
@eetaber AAAAJAJAJAKA
@alex_and_malak thank you! I’m SO angry to see this. I thought @therock was better than this.
😍😍😍😍
Que lindo 😍
❤
Is that real dolphine ?
Какой красивый.
Wow
Beautiful 😍
@muminpractice You say all this yet you have cats in captivity for your personal enjoyment and I didn't see you having a problem with the penguins at #birdworld. I am sure they loved being caged up.  If going to cast stones need not be selective #nodifference
can you campaign to release captured animals？instead of making film using these poor creatures？
Sorry, up just got upstaged
If you're seeing this I would appreciate it if you'd follow me, I draw anime art mostly dbz & naruto
Uauuuu 😍😍😍😍😍

@awheeler8178 @kathrencurley
Save Willy 3 😂?!
Wish they weren’t in tanks though
Beautiful!!!
@peshy85 just thought you’d appreciate it
@alex_and_malak they are not beaten and animals in North American facilities come from captive breeding.
That's so awesome😍🌊💕
@okaysavv
I didnt know you were making a movie with Amy Schumer.
@zanajade_ so why not focus on the bad parks and not condemn them all .
Mais inteligente do q eu

@therock what about @vincent.rocco.vargas? Next co star??
@alex_and_malak best comment!!!
Free the whale Dwayne. You can do it! 🐳
Welcome to the ATL DJ. Hope you enjoy your time here in my hometown.
This is awesome! Looks like you’re really creating a bond lol
In awe of imprisonment? See the torture, depression, sedation in his eyes?
Ugh. There’s no way you’re okay with these beautiful creatures being in captivity. I really hope you stand up for these creatures instead of standing next.
Te gano, puso papel
awww
Nooooo please don’t support these beautiful intelligent animals in captivity. It’s wrong on so many levels 😞
😡😡😡
You’re a piece of shit for thinking this is even remotely okay. You and your family should be ashamed of yourselves... You want to show your kids animals take them to the fucking ocean where you can go see them in the wild. IN THEIR HABITAT. Not some tiny cage where these animals are depressed and abused. SHAME ON YOU.
Awsome love it
😚😚
💖💖💖💖💖😍😍😍😍
If you were in awe of them you would be working to protect them in the wild where they belong NOT encouraging cruel captive facilities. I am SO disappointed, I always thought you were one of those rare compassionate celebrities who used their platform for good. @emptythetanksworldwide I’m glad you guys are speaking up about this and @therock should be supporting the work of organizations like you and @bornfreefoundation instead of contributing to this shameful industry.
LOVE
What’s up with you and all the albino animals. Haven’t you heard “black lives matter”?
@debbie_higgins it is illegal to release captive born whales into the wild as that would violate the Marine Mammal Protection Act. This whale is fine where it is.
Love love belugas
Yea @therock other George :)
Very surprised you’re there to promote the aquarium instead of helping these beautiful and extremely intelligent animals be released from captivity. Pretty disappointing....@therock Hopefully after all these comments and some of your own research you will see that keeping these majestic creatures in captivity is cruel and unusual punishment for them and then maybe you’ll change your stance. One can only hope...
@illabebroadway
They are beautiful creatures.
Do you not remember doing rampage like two months ago
Smarter then your usual co-star @kevinhart4real
It's glorious and it should be in the ocean not an aquarium! 😭
Wawoo awosam...❤️❤️
@absolutjulian 🙏thanks brother

@liberate_cetaceans As a big fan of @therock , it saddens me as well. These poor animals do not belong in captivity.

Whales under human care in America are provided for in ways their wild counterparts could only hope for. Mr. Johnson is not doing anything wrong here and as a marine biologist myself I support the conservation missions of facilities like the #georgiaaquarium

Y'all animal psychos be tripping geez! Yes they are God's creatures but sheesh y'all go harder for animals than you do humans. Ijs

I think I’m actually convinced you’re some sort of prophet from the heavens
Wow wow
#jealous. I love belugas

The whale's head looks like vin diesels head
Whale, that's breaking news.
@therock Isn't the @georgiaaquarium suck an awesome place ?! I think you should swim with the whale sharks.
@theycallmeden I wana go to sea world now lol
😻❤
This is amazing!!!!! 😝
😍😍😍😍😍
@nousernameformethanks I’ve seen the cove . What I’m saying is you have to look at the full picture . Not every marine park supports that . Learn to deferential the good ones from the bad . Closing them down will do far more harm than good
@therock watch The Cove and Blackfish....
You need to do something to protect them as well @therock! They don't belong to an aquarium
Needs to be free though but again out there in the oceans it would be killed by uneducated humans 😢 it’s so beautiful
So cool!!!!!!😁😁😁😁

@pinkcloud_11 so I think to educate yourself on zoos. By that I mean all of them. Some zoos still run how they used to, for the money and don’t do the best things for the animals. But like Everything else, you can’t lump everything together. Do more research into different zoos, the good and the bad. And use RELIABLE resources. For example, don’t use organizations like PETA as a resource.
Looks a bit like @kevinhart4real

Dear @therock You should know that these poor animals suffer in captivity.  I hope this cute beluga can be returned his freedom
Omg the belugas at the Georgia aquarium are hysterical! Love them lol
@_andrew95 on a good day
❤😍
"We urgently need all the help we can get! Understand the limitations of shelters and animal care and control agencies. For instance, you can take a badly injured stray dog to animal control and find out that the agency is unable to provide expensive surgery to treat the dog's injuries. In those cases, shelters may euthanize the animals to relieve their suffering. Virtually all animal control facilities have severe budgetary or space limitations and must make painful decisions about how best to allocate their inadequate resources.
Please share our campaign link so we can all help our beloved friends. Campaign link is: https://www.gofundme.com/mpjnrz-helping-paws Click here to support Helping Paws organized by -Ricardo Renteria Castaneda. Even a small donation can make a big difference to us, and help us continue to make a big difference to the world we live in."

Your co-star could probably carry as many lines as you
People have no sense, the animal is already captured and put in the containment, how is Rock responsible for that, he is just enjoying himself, so let him be..

@kevin_waddell_venom_ my aunt is a marine biologist and im about to start a college course on it, my aunt and i take part in many protests for marine conservation and rights everyone has their different views and opinions but many of the people in these comments agree that this is cruel and these animals being kept in small tanks and being overworked for the amusement of humans is wrong. some animal parks are worse than others and i understand that but it doesn’t make it any less wrong
@garretttaylor5133 yeah im pretty famous now braj
❤️❤️❤️

@indominus16extinction haha you think these animals make facial expressions 😂
amor por la roca!!!
@kevin_waddell_venom_  if you don’t like Blackfish you can watch The Cove for a more in depth look at the industry you’re defending.
I see a buddy cop film brewing in the near future.
Hello white dolphin 🐬
🐬🐬🐬🐬
@indyforbes  wtf I want one
Captivity also helps save animals that would be naturally killed in the wild by humans and other natural predators. Zoos and aquariums have helped many endangered species. Places like sea world I don’t support because they don’t take care of the animals properly, but zoos and aquariums I do support. On the other hand I don’t support the camel riding, elephant riding, dolphin riding, etc,  that some zoos and aquariums have because that’s just exploitation. Zoos and aquariums do take animals that would never make it out in the wild. They would die.
Beautiful 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Awww done big guy to another..sweet. 😄
Awww so sweet
@molittlefield
Wow,this is Rilly awesome

Omg, this is such a heartbreaking disappointment 😔
@zanajade_ not trying to pick a fight either I just hate it when people get so involved without much research . I’ve worked on research with many marine parks and they do so much good .
He is taller than @kevinhart4real for sure🙊

Please, help release it. You know how intelligent they are and reliant on a close knit family. Keeping them in small pools for human entertainment is cruel. 🙏🏼🐋🐬❤️
Awesome
The resemblance tho

@therock you were in town and you didn’t even come thru??! Smh 😏
Shame it's not in the ocean, where it should be.
He looks just like you!!!

Very nice
What has happened to you??? How in the world can you justify giving attention to these cruel, disgusting businesses that just exploit animals that belong in the wild not in a fricking chlorinated pool ???? ☯️👎🏼
@therock be kinda cool if you freed Willie
😍😍😍😍
I think it would be intelligent to let it live out it’s life where it belongs - in the wild with its family ? @therock  you can’t be seriously supporting this.... a person in your kind of power and positing should be FIGHTING these causes - do you want your children to experience a world of animal abuse and corruption????
I was there yesterday and the Beluga’s are my favorite! I’m kinda jelly right now..... I didn’t get to meet either one of you😤
Awesome ❤️

@kmh912 says the spineless Sea-World paid employee
Quite an arm you got there bro
@therock Best if we campaign against animal captivity. #anticaptivity #emptythetanks
@occk23  Yala Habibi
How cute 😍
They capture these animals, take them from the wild and imprison them, in the name of “promoting conservation”. Specifically the Georgia Aquarium imported captured whales from Russia where they had been living in their wild, natural habitat. They aren’t rehabilitated animals or animals that needed human intervention. They are highly social and intelligent and are meant to travel 100 km a day. If you need a whale in a movie, use CGI.
@therock looks like you punched the whale haha 🤣🤣🤣
@wendellplopes 💙😍😍😍
Beautiful
💜💜💜
Dapped him up 🤣🤣🤣
How can you not love the rock
I love this
@kevin_waddell_venom_  look mate i’m not trying to pick a fight in the comments of an instagram post, i am just saying that this kind of thing isn’t right and there are so many others in the comments that clearly agree with me so stop thinking you’re all it and pipe down

Please don’t promote aquariums! These animals don’t deserve to be held captive! They’re damned with “smiles”, just like dolphins... people think they’re always happy, they’re not. Watch Blackfish! #Blackfish

When a beluga whale kidnapped his family, one man won’t rest until they are found. This summmer, Dwayne the rock Johnson stars in....oceans 14, belugas revenge.  This time, it’s personal.  @michalis_aurelius
Probably the first thing you’ve ever posted that I’ve completely thought differently about you for! Yes it’s a beautiful animal but NO it should definitely not be in captivity! I’m surprised any high profile celebrities still go to marine parks, especially after the BlackFish documentary that exposed exactly what conditions these poor animals live in! If you want to witness these beautiful creatures then go out to sea and see them in their HOME
@Kalyane.rohit follow me
For Rampage 2?
Captive staggering intelligence. Now check out ‘Blackfish’.

@griselgamarra It doesn't exploit them for entertainment. It exploits them to promote conservation.
Doesn't take a very bright man to understand that these animals belong in the wild and not in aquariums where they're tortured for idiots' amusement. Then again, this guy is called the rock.

Don't you people blame The Rock, he didn't put the animal there! A lot of hypocrites out there that should look at the way they live, polluting the ocean and air, driving petrol fumed cars, using too much electricity, dumping rubbish, eating cows and pigs, eating all the fish, deodorants, drilling and logging, overpopulation, etc, all because of the 7 deadly sins! This world needs repair! God is pissed off! Wouldn't you all be if people destroyed something you created!

AWESOME!!! They are amazing creatures! 🎉🌎🐋🦈
Hello, a question. Is this your page ?. Look in the Facebook.
@__kgsmith_ #georgiaaquarium
@agmclellan ??
@therock curious to know, the creatures you work with, do you push for them to be released if the circumstances support them so? if not do you at-least acknowledge that these creatures need extremely large enclosures to be kept in, far greater then what they are in now, and if not do you support the idea that they should be taken out for “walks” (big walks) out of their enclosure, so as they can retain their sanity. Im am sure you have seen the orca videos circulating when they attack their trainers, and i would think you would acknowledge or support the idea that these creatures who travel large distances do not belong in these small enclosures. If i do not get a response i understand, but i feel you as an icon for many people from all walks of life, i believe you could start a movement that would inspire many from old, present, and new generations. If you read this i thankyou. Good day sir
❤😍😍😍
@indominus16extinction “does that face look miserable to you” - that is the dumbest fucking thing I have ever read.

@therock, in awe-inspiring way Jehovah has made all things both in heaven and on earth including humans. We can only look at them and give praise to the creator. That is why in psalms 139:14,............ we are wonderfully made. None of these beautiful things came by chance or evolution. There is a master designer and his name is Jehovah and he is the most high over all the earth Psalm 83:18.

@ludacris ✨✨
See even animals like you  and dont listen to the other dumb asses
They're known for always flubbing their lines.
I’ll use my special gift.... Oooooooooooooooooooooo
Beautiful!!
@denissehzb  uuuuu
Zoom in on whales eyes what you looking at👀
Do you smell what the dolphin is cooking
@capatifrancis OMG!!!! 😍😍😍
Looks yummy blubber
@therock hey 👋🏽 i know you’re a good person. Please don’t exploit animals by sharing photos of them when they are trained or forced to do things like “high five”. They belong in the wild and they deserve to have freedom just like you and I. Much love ✌🏽
This beluga should be in the wild, not an aquarium 😢

@victoralmei_ quero fazer isso 😍😍
Cool ,I like
Favorite sea animal... ❤️
@m3lissaweaver
You are amazing !! 😍😍😍
Sumringah bgt si om
@zanajade_  Do you have any idea how much it costs to rescue and release just one animal ? You need to look at the entire package before condemning these places .
Nice shot
Hell even the Beluga whale knows who @therock is too..lol
Same haircut
Me too I just saw them in Texas sea world I live in Colorado Springs Colorado
💜💜💜💜💜
Yes and you both share the same haircut on top of it. Beautiful animal, and the Beluga Whale is adorable too! 😋😎💪😅
💜💜
You always have the best captions 😂
Baileyyyyy  @_josh1225_
Great photo

I love Beluga Whales!
He is dashing too.
Gross, so disappointed to see you supporting animal cruelty @therock

Do you like the 8 movies of fast& furious
@naty_862
That’s messed up man. Huge fan of yours but this is just f’d up. What if your stage was a cage instead of a silver screen?
A-m-a-z-i-n-g! 🤯😂💪
echo-location! ooooooooooooooooooo🙌
@popski625 sis he wasn't captive, this was a patient we had at our clinic who had to heal and was in there temporarily. But nice try 😂 i agree tho,all forms of captivity are just as bad
Love this. Magnificent animals
Awwww I love whales!:))). I was at sea world I. Toronto years ago an wavers by to her and she waved back to me with her fin!:))). I was in tears 😭. Love animals so much!:))) ❤️
@patriot_beh krank du neben @therock
Cute picture @therock
@pinkcloud_11 I also encouraged you to do research on the good things zoos do. There are a ridiculous amount of animals, including Manatees that would have already gone extinct if it weren’t for zoos and aquariums. Sea World is basically the ONLY reason we still have Florida Manatees today.
😍😍😍😍😍
omg 😍😍😍😍
💙
@larshei__ das stimmt 🔥
Hahaha, great caption
Oh 😮 sad you support aquariums holding wild animals in captivity it’s cruel 😭
@amylaurenhunter  @matthunter586

They weren’t supposed to be confined

Superb
Start a petition or link to your cause to stop exhibits like these instead of doing life with your life but commenting on shit like this. Make the change you wish to see instead of waiting for someone else to step up. How many  celebrities did it take until someone did something like Lebron did? Too many if you ask me; goes to show you can’t wait for others.
Co star? Humble Dwyane does it again
@seida.kolasinac you say this and yet are photographed with a horse in captivity. Just as bad. #nodifference
@tonyyysandvoss

❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😍😍😍😍😍😍😚😚😚

@kmh912 you’re either a fool or you work in the animal captivity industry. Because the aquarium in question is doing NOTHING to conserve whales and sharks (WHALE sharks for god sake!!) by holding them in tanks. Wake up.
Procurando dory
The rock and the white 😁
@kikii.kt ☺️ 🐬
Captivity is NOT cool . Please do not promote it.
I  Love  you ❤️
@kevin_waddell_venom_ i would like to yes, it’s important that we care and look after these animals but not keep them in small tanks and work them for peoples entertainment
We love the Georgia aquarium.. Would go every day of we could..
Isso não é legal cara, na verdade esse animal lindo não está no habitat natural dele, isso me deixa triste, na verdade muito triste 😥😫
@mendozaviole 😂😂😂
@therock Dwayne Johnson in Flipper, Dwayne Johnsons in Flipper 2: No Flipping Way, Dwayne Johnson in Flipper 3: Not Flipping Around, Dwayne Johnson in Flipper: the remake of the remake.
@isaac_jay15 we have aquariums to help them and give people the chance to see them. I’ve loved aquariums and zoos my whole life. Had lots of memories made at them. Animals at zoos or aquariums have better lives then ones in the wild, I can promise you
Oh mine!!! Awesome she’s beautiful 😍😍😍
So cute🐬💕

Even the Beluga looks thrilled to get a fist bump from the Rock 👍😂😃

🔥
Who is who!?

@whatszakalakkin it's an opinion and captivity that's cruel
@chris_mitchell16 actually, animals that live in the wild have adapted to live in the wild. They were engineered by nature to swim thousands of miles EVERY DAY and actively hunt for food, only to be trapped in concrete pools from the rest of their lives. These are highly intelligent and self aware creatures. They know they dont have freedom.
👍👍👍👍👍👍
@ju.liadiniz é pelo ângulo, pq na vida real vc n tem hahahaha
Let them free..
wow i was just there and you didn’t say hi wtf
Amazing
Man is that real

Cute

@savtaithudson crazy right! There is no one around. He must have been there when no one else was!
@louielove_ I’ve worked at an aquarium, quick making accusations until you know all the facts.
Not nice! You can Win great money doing other things Too. You dont need to be part of cruelty, captivity and sadness. Be aware of the change @therock

@coldheartcoveredingold stop 😭😭😭😭
Friendly fellow you have there. love it.
@indominus16extinction are you serious? That is totally the wrong approachment for this problem. A wale who travels about 100km a day should not hold in a bigger bathtube. We need to solve the issue at it source, like overfishing.
@sm_xrx weil das Bild voll schön ist 🌚

The Rock is Thanos incarnate. Look at that god damn arm.

@zookeeperjawnie as I said before, there are other sources of information if you don’t like that one. In any case, you are a zookeeper, I am not going to try to convince you against what you do for a living. But I’m sorry, I do not think animals should be kept in cages specially if you make a business out of it.

@chris_mitchell16 STFU - sea animals belong in the sea. They need space to swim. These are smart animals and training them with a whistle is downright degrading.

I think you may not know about the issues that captive mammals face, the cruelty and exploitation and the money these aquariums make at the expense of animals. Their life is Hell in these places

Buluga!!!!
"C’mon. You told me they hadn’t been captured in decades. Here’s evidence of capture from 2016. 
This post, my comment, this discussion is not about the pollution of natural habitat. Pollution is a separate issue entirely. The Beluga whale population is understandably surviving better in their natural habitat than in amusement parks. I never suggested they are plonked back in to the wilderness to die. My point here, along with many, many others is that the promotion, advertising, supporting and encouragement of such places is unethical, unkind, inhumane, unnecessary and damaging. These parks are life sentences of torture and it pains me to see such promotion of these businesses reaching such a vast audience when the message could be so much more positive for nature."
❤️❤️
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
C’mon man, you’re awesome, be above this.  Think of all the money you’ll make and realize that this animal will not benefit from it in any way. Please don’t do this! :(

So disappointed! Wild animals don't belong in captivity. Aquariums exploit marine mammals for entertainment. Please focus on wild habitats, wild animals and real conservation. If you go to a place like this, do it to educate people about the suffering of these animals in their prisons.

Not cool. Not cute. Be intelligent and don’t visit these animals in captivity.

These animals just swim in circles all day.
@therock you have such a positive influence on the world, you are probably one of the most beloved people on the planet. Try to work against putting intelligent mammals such as whales in a bathtub!! They are not here to entertain or do tricks for us, they are a part of a much bigger, majestic and more beautiful reason than that.... it’s called life!! Let them live! #whalesbelongintheocean

I can’t believe people with absolutely no idea can try and tell people what’s going on . Do some research on positive reinforcement training . You think they are forced ? If a animal doesn’t want to do a behaviour it won’t !! . They get fed regardless .

"I work at the Georgia Aquarium and a lot of our animals are rescues, the belugas in their natural habitat are slowly starving because of rising temperatures in the ocean their food has been going to greater depths and belugas can’t hold their breath that long and it takes a lot of energy from them to dive deep, with the Georgia Aquarium rescuing them they had a home to go to with a constant food source so that they can actively thrive. 
Our whale sharks where rescued as well before the GA Aquarium rescued them, fishermen caught them in their habitat and where going to butcher them for food 
Every Human Care facility is not sea world in black fish"
Black fish documentary - this is animal cruelty @therock keeping these majestic creatures caged for corporate profits 😪
Greatt 😍😍
❤❤❤❤
Is it real 🤷‍♀❤❤😂
Who would win in a head butting contest?
How about using your fame to break him out of there?
This man is as big as the whale
@griselgamarra you're dumb. The georgia aquarium only takes in animals the require it and they are rehabilitated until they can be released again. I've been many times.
Wow!🐬💕
Love is in the air 😍
Hope @therock can give more background to why this magnificent creature is in an aquarium and what looks like a trick its performing.
🔥
I cant understand if the rock exaiting cuz he touch a whale or the whale cuz it touch the rick

Siiiiick 😬
They should be free and not forced into captivity
😍😍
Both are sweet
😍 the rock. 💞💞💞
Extremely disappointed that you would support the captivity industry. These animals suffer greatly in these oversized bathtubs. They have a shorter than expected lifespan, are trained by using a method called food deprivation, if they don’t perform the correct manoeuvres the correct time, they aren’t fed. Most that are “wild caught” are captured in horrific drive captures, where they witness their family members who aren’t deemed “pretty enough” for the captivity industry, slaughtered in front of them. Please read up on the dolphin project, or sea shepherd & they show exactly how the majority of whales & dolphins you see in facilities like these & the swim with dolphin experiences, end up here.
Thought I was your next co-star 😩😩😩
Cool

Please do not support aquariums. If this beluga can’t be released to the wild, support sanctuaries where they aren’t “trained” for photo ops with celebrities. Love you Rock, but do better on this issue.
@lucyriddle noooooo 😭😭
These croutons buy the orphaned animals slautered in hunts for meat industry  YOU SUX DWYANE
Oh that is sweet. Need to be on your one of shows. 🐋🐋🐋🐋

You look so tiny next to it!

Awwww😍😍😍
Cue Raffi’s baby beluga!
👍🏻
@evadelaneyy 😂😂 🐋
Gorgeous xx
I love this!!!
@therock We forget, humans are animals as well.... and the worst kind.
Then you would know the pool you met this animal in is an actual prison.  They may have saved it at first but now, it's a prisoner.
Seriously, you were in Atlanta and I didn't know!!! Wtf 😭😭😭
In a tank? 😩😱🦈 #shouldbefree
Awesome!!!
@kklutch1911 next trip!
@mannygiannopoulos this is so cool!!! #goals
Literally my favorite. They behave like puppies and so smart!

@therock Please do not contribute to the exploitation of the beautiful sea creatures. They belong in the ocean, nowhere else. Please be a voice for the voiceless and not a contributor to they're captivity and exploitation for financial gain
Cool so cute

Epic picture 🙌🏼🏁
❤️💙
Cute
😍😍😍😍😍
My favorite pic of all time 😍😍😍
I've seen people catch fish with their bare hand before but pulling an entire whale out of the water is next level
It is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.😊
Hmmm,  I have this aversion to Beluga’s ever since a guy coworker asked me at 8.5 months pregnant “Are you having a baby or a Beluga?” Let’s just say he avoided me for the remainder of my time before my maternity leave....
Two of the most beautiful baldies ever 😆
Aww 💕👍
@jblomquistt  I need to do this
They are my favorite 😍😍😭😭😭😭❤️
I was just there and I meet a beluga
Sweet!👏👏👏
😆💞
Probably the same thing people do to their dogs and cats!! #nodifference
Don’t support captive animals @therock
@minichefpaloma Beluga!
So cute
@dyne7 why did you think I tagged you? Maybe the animal can’t survive in nature you have no idea as do I.
@eanatuazon 🐒🐸

Love The Rock but we have to #emptythetanks don’t support aquariums
Not cool
Me encanta esta imagen.grandioso!
Omfg we missed the rock at the aquarium today, crying @weighfairerr
Love this man
@puppy.girl they are losing there habitats and the aquarium is helping them
@vikkylonie those whales were already in captivity there tho. We(the U.S.)didn’t initiate the capture, just the change of location. I know some places try to get around laws banning their capture in the wild, but most haven’t in quite some time. It will take time for both humans to stop polluting natural habitats and for more facilities to accept the fact that they don’t need to keep these animals in tiny habitats. Just as more circuses are finding refuges and sanctuaries for their elephants and big cats. Even the trainers have been vocal in this change. It won’t happen overnight and many can’t go back in the wild unless you want them to die.
Jajajajajaa
@therock looks like you punched it in the face 😵
@geggia_felicidad  bellissima. Ma guarda che fronte! 😍
@_eva_val very disappointing....
The rock is cooking whale😉😂💕💕🙏🇮🇳

@smup21 I'm just saying that even though animals shouldn't be locked up zoos and aquariums, unfortunately as a result of humanity's arrogance and ignorance they are safer from us in zoos and aquariums compare to their natural habitats. Basically humans need to sort their shit out asap.

@carlsmilla and what have you done for your community or animals
@sonic2726 you stated “these aquariums”. I’ve done my homework on all of this and have done so for years. Wild life sanctuaries are great..zoos and  aquariums are not. Some may qualify as such, but more often than not it’s a ruse . Sea-pens would be the proper way to help rescue animals. Doing stunts and movies is not wildlife rehabilitation. You gotta dig deeper man.

Georgia aquarium lost 6 belugas in 8 years . They fought tooth and nail to import wild caught belugas from Russia because hey they didnt have them ripped away from their homes away from their families but someone already did so can they just have them. I'm so disappointed in this picture and have lost a lot of respect for this individual 😥
Ah you big beluga you 😆💙

@rosaleon7088  Mira! Me tome una foto con the rock!
@chity14 I’m not saying it’s perfect, a lot of better techniques come from what they learned in Aquariums and zoos...it’s about the academics of it also hard to inspire and show a kid up close about these animals in their natural habitat
So cute !

I just did this in june for my birthday
This is not a cool picture. @therock you are promoting this cruelty. Instead you should fight to FREE and ban these activities used for entertainment. They belong in the sea... not ponds & aquariums to do tricks for humans.
I’m just here to see all the “animal lovers” that are gonna complain about this whale being captive when they’ve done 0 things for their community 😂
Which one is smarter? @kevinhart4real or that whale?
@danrimington the animal lives like a fucking millionaire, get over it when animals show signs of stress they would know
Well Rock, i thought you were cool until now. Using whales in captivity? You should be ashamed!! #notcool #boycottseaworld
Wow that's awesome love that he? Or she is white Uniqueness 😀
Hermosoooooo
Oh man @therock I love ya and support ya im still a fan. As soon as I saw the pic I knew the hate was coming. Sucks you cant just be a regular guy at an aquarium anymore.
@emil_jonsson You act like you dont own a fish or cat Etc.
@hiitsashmarie heart breaking I know. I felt the same ☹️💔
So unique
Nooooo!!!! I would have thought in your line of work you would have seen Blackfish and The Cove!!!! Captivity kills, these marine animals belong in The Oceans living wild and free!! Shame on you @therock !!!

I think you should your rightly earned fame to campaign AGAISNT keeping intelligent marine mammals in captivity not the other way around dude.
"@terahdox decades you say? In 2016 this specific aquarium, Georgia Aquarium initiates the hunt and capture of 18 Beluga whales. The National Oceanic Atmospheric Association DENIED the Georgia Aquarium the import of these Beluga Whales that they “ordered” from Russia. Forcing them, begrudgingly, to announce in November 2016 ( just 22 months ago) that they will no longer be capturing beluga whales and dolphins for their “circus”. They claim to be capturing wild marine life in the interests of conservation, despite the Beluga whale thriving in the wild but declining in aquariums. Any organisation with conservation at the forefront does NOT require trainers to teach the animals to entertain for the twisted pleasure of the human species. Enough research?

https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.thedodo.com/amphtml/georgia-aquarium-stops-catching-wild-marine-mammals-1877822888.html"
For a second I thought you were punching that poor animal @therock
Holy sh**t he shook hands with a beluga
@marseille_lucas  have you ever trained a dog before ? This is a typical uneducated comment . Maybe look into positive reinforcement training .
@amy_twigg_
Everyone’s so passionate about animal cruelty when it comes to the dog festival, orcas, and zoos but many still eating and exploiting them everyday 🤔 #GoVegan
@mattybizzle89 😍
@therock dude not cool. Visit them in the wild. You have the means to do that. #freewilly #woke
Free the Damn Beluga Dwayne! WTF your agent is slipping! These animals belong in the ocean! @therock #endaquariums #freewilly #wtf #johncenawouldntdoit
Y’all so dumb smdh. Go after the big corporate companies that keep these creature in cages. The rock does not involved himself in such matter. He just want to sightsee w his family..like many millions of families over the world
Bruh let it go into the wild
@alexamassey4 @han.rosee
@megaabetch
Sorry but this is SO wrong. This beautiful intelligent animal shouldn’t be in captivity and your promoting and supporting this torture??? It’s a big fat no from me.
@bowen_sparks wtf how would you like to be caged in a pool ur whole life, only being able to eat food when humans choose to give it to you. Have no decoration to even make you feel like ur at home, have barely any space to move. So no it’s not having the time of it’s life, it’s miserable and lonely and shame on whoever supports this cruelty
Awwww❤️❤️❤️❤️
Why do you look good with a beluga whale
Wowwww🙌🙌🇵🇪🇵🇪✨
Thats pretty cool
Love it 🐋🐋🐳🐳🐬🐟
@henrysheridan
I'm actually shocked you would even go to, much less support a place like this!!!! This is base animal cruelty and I would be ashamed to post a photo like this! Man, I'm disappointed in you...smh
Is that in SeaWorld
Rips off the fin of the Beluga
Que foto más tierna ,me encanta !!
Disgusting #stopcaptivity 😡😡
They have a hippocampus the size of a human brain .. ..these animals are smarter than humans. We aren't yet smart enough too understand this or really appreciate  them as equal.  If we could teach dolphins the known laws of physics they would be saving humanity from extintion yet we are not doing the reverse
How irresponsible, they let a silverback gorilla 🦍 into the whale enclosure? @therock
The Belugas were one of my favorites during my visit!
@therock super disappointed, your actions and beliefs DO NOT align with mine, so I will be unfollowing. Educate yourself on the abuse and tortured these innocent beings experience Just so stupid people can get rich and be entertained!
@emil_jonsson 👋 bye. ✌🏾 I don’t think he cares 😂😂 he’s still got millions of other followers. Good riddance

They should be in the ocean!!!! NO IN AQUARIUM !
@jessica_salamon yes!! Amazing times
@therock I've been wanting to go to the aquarium for years.  I seen the photo with your Ohana and it motivates me even more to take my Fanmi (creole) more. Especially since we're moving to Atlanta in as couple month for our acting career. Thank you for the punctures brother 🤙🏾🤙🏾💪🏾💪🏾

@paulwalker was still alive you’d be getting shit from him, did his marine biology legacy mean nothing to you? stop using captive animals as entertainment, its disgusting... watch Blackfish on Netflix before you start filming crap films with animal cruelty"
💛🙌🏻 We had the opportunity to swim with these amazing animals at the Georgia aquarium, they are gorgeous. You are an amazing man!
@alejandrosierra4 @yves_valera cualquier parecido con la realidad... Es la puta verdad jaja
I love love l9ve beluga whales they are beautiful and cute creatures!!!!

You are-obviously- an  intelligent person .. So why? This shit? No no no......... This is cruel
@jules0623 😍😍😍
Always been a huge fan, but am really disappointed. These animals shouldn’t be in captivity. It’s horrible for them. 😢
好可爱
Dope
Haters just way overreacting...next we'll be seeing " @therock posted a pic of himself today punching a white whale...proof that he hates animals!"
He doesn't know who is in front of him @therock ♥😍😍
Beauty
Amazing
Ohhh beautiful
Sooo... You dont have someone to guide you of what is convenient to upload? Or you just dooont give a fuck haha. Damm i thought u were smart

FIN DIESEL
@carlsmilla please show me some evidence of this ? Show me they are all dying a slow painful death ?
Cute @f3tjang
Cetaceans like the beluga whale are too emotionally complex and intelligent to live a good, healthy life in captivity. Aquariums are suitable environments for many fish, but not cetaceans.
Its White cachalot normalement ? 😂
Is that a dog?
Not cool :(
How cute 💖. And it looks like you both shared the same stylists 😻
Haha
Beautiful animal is very inteligent. I love the dolphin.

Haters gonna hate. Just because he posted this picture doesn’t mean he supports animal captivity. It’s probably meant for something else and these people are just jealous.
That be a cool movie like u. Get. Stranded then your only friend was the wale
@matthew_mudd I did not say they got the beluga in Georgia. I didn’t even say they rescued it. I simply said some animals are rescued

Such a shame he is on captivity. We really need to stop supporting attractions like zoos and aquariums 😢😭
Beluga bros!
Shit that’s real. I thought it was a mascot
@sonic2726 they just sold you a bag of bullshit and u bought it... Bro honestly, you reaaaally think that? Did u properly search of what they do? Or just copying and pasting...?
Too cute
"@therock Awesome is right, and an enclosed environment is no place for one unless recovering from injury. “Dolphins are intelligent and social creatures that, in the wild, interact with hundreds of pod-mates, hunt communally, and have entire coastlines as their playground. In captivity, all of this is lost. Social partners are restricted to a handful of tank-mates. Captive dolphins are fed dead fish (wild dolphins only catch and eat live fish) and they face a profound reduction in space and stimulation. 
Dolphins in the wild may swim up to 40 or 50 miles in a day and can dive to depths of hundreds of feet. Even in the largest captive facilities, dolphins have access to less than 1/10,000 of 1% (0.000001%) of the space available to them in their natural environment. Because of this, dolphins in captivity are often restricted to swimming in circles. In many dolphins, this behavior is a sign that the dolphin is suffering psychologically; it is engaging in what is known as a stereotypical behavior. For an inquisitive, intelligent creature like the dolphin, a barren tank offers no exploratory stimuli compared to the vast, complex ocean.”"
🤩
@kevinhart4real is that the dolphin 🐬 you had fired from seaworld. 😅😅😅😅
He’s like bro stop looking at me like a Stay Puff Marshmallow.
Shameful to promote imprisoned animals
He has your forehead dawg 😂😂🤪
Not cool. I LOVE absolutely everything you do, this I HATE. If you truly respected and appreciated this creature's intelligence you would not be promoting their captivity.
Sad.
Even Beluga Whales know an Alfa when they see one.
I luve Belugas. Soooo cuteee

Hopefully not ‘performing’ for humans and stressed by the experience
Qlo que le pega a los delfines :v
Legit no where does it say he does or doesn’t support oceanic animal captivity. He simply likes the mf whale and its species, chill tf out

🔥🔥🔥🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗<3
@therock you’re in a position to educate millions of people with your fame, popularity, humility, and kindness.  @richardobarry puts his entire heart and soul into trying to end whale and dolphin captivity. He may be an immense teacher and asset for you and your film. I kindly ask you keep an open mind to learning the many harsh realities and conditions these animals many times must endure. #emptythetanks @dolphin_project @leonardodicaprio #wildandfree

Why he wasn’t there when we was @carlawilmaris
Disgusting
@therock I can’t “like” this picture :( you’re a smart person, so I ask you to learn about mammals that use echolocation, and why they don’t belong in aquariums.
My favorite creature in the world, and I love you too Dwayne.  lol ❤
Is real ???

Nice moment
see wildlife in captivity, is sad :(

@wonderfulmrfox dogs are happy because you say so? Whales are happy with human family too. Aquarium makes money off animals, dog owners generate their own happiness out of the dogs. Looks just as same and selfish to me.
Here in Quebec you can see them in the wild, they don’t necessarily high five but they’re free! I really admire the person you are @therock and I hope the story line is you being the bad ass hero freeing them !

while I don't agree with the captivity, sadly, I believe it's too late for these animals.  Unless there is a way to teach them how to feed themselves.  Before people judge, remember that.
I went there 2 months ago. Man @therock when can I go somewhere popular and meet you there? Because I can smell what you are cooking.

This is enslavement & abuse. You are perpetuating this animals ongoing torment. Please research & realise how wrong this is. So cruel.
Wow. I had so much more respect for you before seeing this. Please don’t support captivity. It’s incredibly cruel. Watch “The Cove” and you’ll see how families are terrorized, ripped apart, and murdered just for you to be able to enjoy an momentary experience. #captivytkills #emptythetanks
It's got abbs of steel😂

Bald twins separated at birth, right? LOL!
Dude, these places seriously mistreat animals and cause them a lot of stress. I love following you and respect you a lot but someone with your influence on social media should be doing the opposite of promoting an aquarium! This just epitomises the problem with social media!

"Baby Beluga in the deep blue sea,
Swim so wild and you swim so free.
Heaven above, and the sea below,
And a little white whale on the go.

Baby beluga, baby Beluga, is the water warm?
Is your mama home with you, so happy.

Way down yonder where the dolphins play,
Where they dive and splash all day,
The waves roll in and the waves roll out,
See the water squirting out of your spout.

Baby beluga, baby Beluga, sing your little song,
Sing for all your friends, we like to hear you.

When it’s dark, you’re home and fed,
Curl up snug in your water bed.
Moon is shining and the stars are out,
Good night, little whale, goodnight.

Baby beluga, baby Beluga, with tomorrow’s sun,
Another day’s begun, you’ll soon be waking.

Baby Beluga in the deep blue sea,
Swim so wild and you swim so free.
Heaven above and the sea below,
And a little white whale on the go.
You’re just a little white whale on the go.  I can't believe I just typed this much lol @therock"

It’s not even possible to hate on my dogg @therock . Dude out here building relationships with whales!
@heisenbird1015 blairdrummond zoo in Scotland has successfully re-introduced a healthy captive population of turkey vultures that were on the brink of being classified as technically extinct. Now this animal thrives thanks to the zoo captive program and the money the zoo has spent in the native land of the turkey vulture educating locals, researching methods of making electricity lines visible (the 2nd biggest killer next to poaching to the turkey vulture). Doing all this has helped this species thrive. That’s 1 case of 100’s that zoos around the world have helped save animals from extinction.

you could use your position to go against animal cruelty like dicaprio, would never have expected this from you, i think that you have lost many followers and supporters, you should just scroll through these comments and look at all the people who think this is so wrong

Oooooooooooooooo @harry_cox98
@carlsmilla think this. What if the animal is really injured and needs medical attention, that’s what aquariums are for. If any animal via a beluga whale for example is injured, common sense says to bring in the creature to the aquarium so it can get better and then eventually they’ll release it back into the wild. So what would common sense tell you, leave the animal to die in the ocean just for the sake of “freedom” or to bring it in the aquarium to save its life. #commonsense
@puppy.girl Exactly! They are queens & kings while living wild & free; as they should be!!
That's adorable, it's the perfect partner! Was it your first time petting an interacting with a whale?
Amazing!! 🙌🏼🌎
Ughhhh NO - marine mammals have no place in captivity. So bummed to see this.

They so smart they know they are captivated smh
Awesome
❤️❤️❤️
Please @therock look at the research of Dr. Naomi Rose and Ingrid Visser. Talk to Ric O’Barry from the Dolphin Project. Talk to former marine park trainers like Samantha Berg, Jeffrey Ventre and John Hargrove. Captivity hurts all animals but cetaceans suffer some of the worst injustices of all-bored all day they go mad in those tanks, suffer significant chlorine burns, and are often separated from their family members. It’s so so cruel.

@ethans.animal.photography that’s not even what I meant 🤦🏻‍♀️ oh trust me I’m pro wild so I know exactly what you’re talking about. You should never send any animal that born in captivity into the wild. I’m very educated. But when I mean set it free I meant set the truth free so you don’t need to get mad 😂
My absolute favourite animal, what your doing now is on my bucket list. So beautiful and they have such intelligence and emotions❤️❤️❤️❤️

Please don't support or promote aquariums. Watch Blackfish if you're not in the know. There's no excuse for keeping animals in captivity for human amusement and entertainment.
@jtkones
@martuwartelski @elemartinezp JAJAJAJJAJAJAJA
@rjolinski 😊
How very very sad
The reason some animals are kept in captivity is because they can't survive in the ocean due to injuries or their ecosystem is being torn up and there isn't much space for them to go. They won't go to a perfectly fine beluga whale and decide to take it with them. Most of the time it's done to protect the animals and they are being taken care of.
Photo lit 🔥
Ohhhhh 😍👌🏼😘
That is so beautiful! 😊😊😊❤️❤️❤️

Aww yay glad you got to meet a beluga buddy, they are pretty awesome, but watch out they will steal your thunder with their cuteness. Don't listen to these animal activists, many don't even know that these are 2nd generation animals born in human care. And alot fo aquariums rescue marine mammals.

What about all the animals we have as pets that belong in the wild???? Like snakes, rabbits, fish, even horses and birds.... these animals get treated way better than a lot of people's pets so maybe instead of giving him such a hard time for going and seeing such a beautiful creature maybe go post your comments on a "boycott pets" page.

That dolphin has a rock on it...lol
@ginjdaninj I do not wish to put your points down or belittle your stance. I only hope that you see that he does not own or take pride in keeping this animal behind bars. But rather than attaching one man, you fight against the companies that stripped these animals from their families - not outside and inside Seaworld as many calves are ripped from their mothers and sent to other sea worlds - so that justice can truly be served. If anything I think we should encourage the rock to see this cruelty and hope that he may raise awareness about the cruelty brought to such beautiful animals
Yesss

@justlexinotlexis as you wish
Omg 😲 that’s awesome you got to do that! We did it years ago and it still is a amazing memento
@jeannetteebruno aquariums do a lot of good, for conservation, awareness, education and research. I don’t personally think they should be banned as most of the ones I’ve been to have shown very clearly how much they care for every creature they house, but large scale animals like dolphins and whales should absolutely not be held in captivity, there’s just never enough space for them.
I was just there yesterday @bald__head

@therock my wife surprised me last year for our anniversary with a trip to swim with the belugas there .  Love those guys and favorite animal at the Georgia aquarium
The creatures looking at the camera lense it is that smart 😱😱
🤩
@therock That’s so cool 😎. I love beluga whales 🐋 😃. That’d be cool to see you and him in a film together 😃🐋🐋🐋🐋 keep livin the good life 🤟🏽🤟🏽 #belugawhales
Seriously? You are supporting caging these beautiful animals in the name of entertainment? Wild animals belong in the wild, they are not playthings for us to use and exploit. It doesn’t take staggering intelligence to understand this simple logic. What you do, thousands will do too. Really thought you would know this by now. If you are a real superstar do not stand for exploitation of animals who can’t speak for themselves. @therock
So is this ok cause I do t know he whole story lol
😘
@stepharth
@jsendiz this one! Let’s watch. 😅

Absolutely beautiful. Would be even more beautiful out in the ocean not in a tank. 😢 really wish you weren’t a supporter. You pretty much just crushed my heart. 💔
Whales in bathTubs . Not cool @therock
🙈this breaks my heart!! You should use your voice as a platform and stop these horrible aquariums and not support them. heartbreaking
@therock  @kevinhart4real jk jk😂
#Delfinarija

That’s the only Celebrity I think if I met I would pass out! 😂😂😂Maybe one day @therock
Cool!
Oh no, why do animals have to be in Hollywood movies 😔
@therock 🤟😝🤟
@danrimington I agree never use a delicate animal in this movie the pond is ridiculous!
@whatszakalakkin Seriously, what is wrong with you? Telling ppl they have no friends, cursing them? Gtfo
👍💪
Pixar?
❤️❤️❤️❤️
you have a platform to speak to 112 million of people (your followers) and you're choosing to speak by promoting captivity?? Oh man..
@ebourn89 we should have just made the trip there and been able to see him!
Wow seriously. Why would you support this.
@daniela_93rm amiga mira esta belleza 😍❤

I love the Beluga - awesome post
#Blackfish comes to mind

Jump free willy
@craig.humps Exactly, and don't forget that @iansomerhalder does A LOT of amazing things for all animals, the environment, and people too❣️
@casper0810 He was as spying asking me what I doing. I dare not say, " Babe, I was just checking out how sexy the  Rock is." Lolololololol pray for me... lololol
Oh really ? 😠
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
Use CG animals not wildlife.
Awwww, soooooo cute~~~💕💕💕
The rock is just as big as this whale ahahaha
Surprised you like this thought this would be the last thing you’d post
Awww
@jujuatheart_ I understand your stance on this opinion. I too believe that keeping animals in captivity or cruel and inhuman. However, this beluga whale is already captains and so cannot be released into the wild. And also, in no way does The Rock entertain or promote the idea that keeping these animals in captivity is acceptable. Don’t hate someone for having appreciation of an animal they cannot release, Instead, hate those that put them there in the first place; Greedy, lowlife companies that only care about money.
How could you???
@idaaaaa_z ❤️❤️
👍👍👍
@josh.521 bahahahahahahahahaha nice reasoning, NOT
I smell a movie
He/she looks like he/she smells what The Rock is cookin
that animal has no hair, oh wait. and the beluga too 😄

Hi @therock please salutami
it's the Rock of the seas.. 😏
@abbeysocool omg that’s me tho
You 100% one hit killed that thing
❤❤❤❤
@therock  Just think how much easier the dolphin will be to work with compared to @kevinhart4real
Why'd you punch that Beluga?
that is verey cute man
Everybody jumping to conclusions. It’s easy to cast stones- what exactly are any of u doing for these animals.... the more aware ppl are of them, the more they can help. There is research being done here and rescues. Shldnt judge a book by its cover. Not every institution is evil just bcuz most zoos are disgusting. That is why marine biology is a field of study. Places like this are created to HELP these animals... just like old ppl go into assisted living once they need help to care for themselves...

@therock can’t be any worse then Kevin Hart
@ethans.animal.photography I'd also like to point out YOU called me uneducated first. So anything after that is on you. I'm also not going to spew out my credentials to some stranger on Instagram. But calling someone uneducated without actually knowing is equivalent to shots fired.
Poor guy stuck in captivity for human entertainment. Totally disappointed to see you support this
@peach_girl_909
@aliceedonati morta
@somerdujon took him a while but now he’s cool enough to hang out with us
C'mon Dwayne you're better than that! Fuck keeping these amazing animals in a puddle for their lives @therock
@isergiofurtado omg!!george beluga!! Lol
Welcome to my hometown. C’mon over for dinner.  We make a mean homemade pasta and bolognese!
"What are you doing? We thought Dwayne Johnson was a smart guy but we were wrong ! How dare you posing next to this poor beluga whose life was taken for greed? Don't you read? Don't you see?
Don't you know that people are taking actions  for this Marin parks to stop existing  and you think it's a smart move to promote them ? 
Don't  you know that families of dolphins are thorn apart for money? Don't you know that some orcas at sea world have been in-prisoned  for more than 30 years because some soulless greedy  people decided to? Don't you know that this beluga was not born to give high fives and wave at people but to  live  free  in the ocean with his siblings?
You know people respect you for being a good actor but among these people there are those who care about animal and that are fighting against animal cruelty 
They are disappointed...."
Please don't encourage animals that are in captivity

I love all you do Dwayne but I have to say a beluga in captivity is not ok. #blackfish
Hey @therock I know you probably cant scan through all 9000 comments but I would just like to take this moment to thank you to being such a positive role model my six-year-old daughter thinks you're the funniest guy in the world
@therock that beluga got a six pack. Haha nice photo
Captivity sucks dick
@avgi_procopiou

Animals deserve freedom 😥😥😥
@bronky13 sorry @ricobarrydolphinproject
So cute can't wait to see you guys in action!
💕
So sweet
the animal knows what belongs
Beautiful!!!
they r soooo soft
Know what would be way cooler? If that incredible whale wasn’t trapped in a tank like some circus animal for your/our enjoyment. @therock please consider the effect of you endorsing whales being kept in captivity.
Woww

@colecoffee oh the dream!
Triste!
Ow So Cuuute😍💙
I could be wrong but I think he wanted a kiss!!!😗🤩
@therock I really hope you take in consideration most of the comments on here.  A role model such as yourself should not be supporting wildlife in captivity.. it's cruel and senseless.  Please make a stand and stop this.  Check out @thedoplinproject for the real true

This makes me sad because I’m sure the Rock is such a nice guy and maybe he hasn’t seen Blackfish....these poor animals are taken away from the wild and trained to seem intelligent when really they are abused...I’m not a vegan or an activity by any means, but maybe watch The Cove or Blackfish, and you’ll feel differently about this! ☹️
Love Belugas

Punching whales how huh? First gorillas then skyscrapers and now whales?? When will it end...
So many people so much hate. The same animal that could've been raised from birth due to being ostracised by its family for possibly being the weakest has been loved and given a home in a suitable habitat instead of left to die. Maybe a lot of you would be happier if the animal died young and in the wild. At least they got to live a life and have something more. And moreover no one here speaks animal to know that they're just unhappy and if you speak animal it's the wrong voices in your head you're listening to

this is profoundly fucked up @therock. super disappointed in you dude 😔
Nooooo. You didn’t. You are such a smart, respectful and well educated man. You must know of the suffering these animals endure in captivity.  I’m truly surprised and disappointed to see you endorsing the captivity of whales.
Woooowww
What's your playlist for workout bro?
"All these people here crying cause the rock is hanging with a very spoiled beluga talking  bout animal cruelty , while  they eat their hamburger .
Millions of cows and other animals in captivity being tortured  to satiate y’all appetites and end up as your waste in a toilet .
I’m vegetarian  and an animal being treated well in captivity doesn’t bother me in the least .
How bout you free the billlions of animals being kept for meat ?! Either stop eating meat or get off this post and STFU"
@therock man you gotta be careful with those big animals in little cages like that. How you feel to live in Iron Paradise with only a ten pound barbell for the rest of your life? Always a fan 🙏
@griselgamarra well done 👍 🙏
@kristenlortsher seriously in awe

I wish there were a dislike button because I'd be pressing it. No @therock instead of promoting animals in captivity why don't you go and promote a beluga whale in its natural habitat where it belongs. Well done on promoting captive animals in tanks!
The Rock. The Whale. Nice.
@kattalack195 My apologies. I meant to say you had an extremist philosophy
@tim7bo21 you have no friends
@danieldore317 idiot, it wants to be in the ocean - it’s a wild animal. It doesn’t want to be performing for humans. How about I lock you up in a house, feed you, no taxes - you’ll be safe. But you’ll be dancing 4 times a day for millions of viewers - you can never leave. Sound good?
This animal belongs in the ocean. And YOU SHOULD NOT SUPPORT ANIMAL ABUSE!!!! #shameonyou

Oh no! An animal of such “staggering intelligence” reduced to doing tricks for its human masters. This is heartbreaking

@therock another movie!!?? Dang bro you’re killin’ it!
oh me too- did u ever do a movie🎥🎬 with one...
Beautiful beautiful beautiful
@cherokeewolf4558 his
Come on @therock you are a beautiful animal with staggering intelligence, so I thought you’d be smarter than this!!! Animals in captivity that have to train to do tricks are HELD HOSTAGE in confinement of a small tank, most likely ripped from their mother in the wild or bred in captivity where they lose their minds. PLEASE educate yourself on captive animals for human entertainment BEFORE agreeing to a movie or photos on social media 😔 you’re better than this, set a better example, please. - this is not a social media troll, I’m an actual fan- voicing my educated & statistically accurate opinion. Please. 💔
@pabloa_silviac jajajajaajjajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajsjjsjjsja
normally love everything you do.. But these beautiful, intelligent animals belong in the wild and not something equivalent to a bathtub #thanksbutnotanks
In 2018, Do 1.374.380 people really think that imprisoning these beautiful animals with staggering intelligence in a fish tank is cool? Cetaceans have highly complex brains yet pitty that they are kept in prisons not where they originally belong to -OCEANS- This is utterly disappointing to see especially promoted by a celebrity plus millions of likes shows how captivity of sentient beings normalised by society💔👎@therock

I used to have the utmost respect for you as a decent human being, and then you do this.  You have a lot of followers and with that comes a responsibility.  Photos like this on your Instagram are shameful.  #blackfish 😧😧😧
Can I be you for 5 minutes so I can go behind the scenes and touch a beluga?
You should frame that Baby. .
😍😍😍
@foppman
The Georgia aquarium takes these juvenile belugas from they are pods while they are still nursing. The Georgia aquarium has lost eight or nine belugas in their care. Belugas should not be in tanks for entertainment. Boycott Georgia aquarium #emptythetanks #captivitykills #georgiaaquarium #blackfish #thecove
@therock 😞that awesome beluga whale is a prisoner for life and forced to perform tricks for human entertainment
So sad that these beautiful animals have to used for the sole purpose of human entertainment 😔😔😔😔😢😢😢😢
@tim7bo21 thank you 🙏👏

@willybeamin87 belUUUUGA!!
They are smart as dogs and precious as angels.
Lástima q no esté en su hábitat natural sino encerrado en un acuario 👎
@therock you shouldn’t be supporting this. No animals let alone dolphins should be in captivity. They deserve to be out in the ocean exploring  instead of being cooped up in a small area for human entertainment. They don’t deserve this. They can’t talk  don’t mean they aren’t in pain.
Lame.
@hiitsashmarie thank you 🙏
He’s cute is he Albino!! So Sad that he is limited with his movements! I say let him go free to the ocean as well!
Cool
@nherms11 it's meesee
Ah man, I love you @therock - but aquariums are the worst.
@chris_mitchell16 No ya don’t!
No Dwayne no!!! Gutted to see this.
Don’t support aquariums or exploiting animals in films,he should be free and in the wild dude

Staggering intelligence..but is put in a prison for human entertainment 🤔..that'd be like having multiple PhDs and the only job you could get was being inside the suit of a B list Disney character at the theme parks.
That’s the whale from finding dory with the echolocation lol
IF YOU WERE YOU WOULD KNOW HIM THAT THATS NOT HOW HE MEANT IT!!HES SUCH A GOOD MAN AND TO HAVE YOU PEOPLE ATTACK HIM THIS WAY YOU ALK ARE FORTUNATE YOU ARENT STANDING IN FRONT OF ME!!💥😤✊
@64moonie
They belong at sea
Damn Rocky, I thought you’d be with your followers. These creatures shouldn’t be in captivity. Sanctuaries are different, but “for profit” zoo’s and aquarium’s are terrible places. They should not be supported. Really disappointed with this one.
Why would you upload a photo like this man, very disappointed 😔 @therock

@therock nice photo, jabroni!
@kmh912 how are they “critical”? I’ve learned lots via David Attenborough and Not once did he film in aquariums. Seeing these animals is a privilege not a right. What can you learn from a captive whale? Not about their migration paths, not about their communication, their diet, their behaviour, their family structure. Nothing. Whale spotting exhibitions are the best way to raise funds and awareness. And don’t start with the “sick” animal line- sick animals should be allowed to try and survive or be treated and released. Keeping them in captivity is ALL about money.

@kattalack195 I did. I used knowledge of operant reinforcement. Learned on my own that those anti cetas under human care are scams. The only argument an extremist like you can give is that you don’t want to see them in tanks. It’s both a reasonable but ridiculous argument at the same time. In the last couple of decades these animals lives have improved a lot. Facilities that hold cetaceans in the US have improved so much since the 60’s, 70’s, And even early 80’s. And if you compare the animals lives from back then to now you understand they are improving daily. They are receiving more stimulation, they are living longer, and they are starting to thrive.

Ça c'est de l'amour 😄 this is a true love
Great stuff Dwayne dude. Good to see that you’re not a blackfish sheep like most people. Can’t believe people still quote that so called ‘documentary’ that was based on lies and twisted truths.
I wish that was me shaking your hand :(
Heartbroken you think these animals are kept safe? Please consider your position
Love this!!! #georgiaaquarium  is Amazing!

"Oh no! I thought you knew enough about animal captivity to not visit and to NOT use one in a film? Please do better and learn from these messages in the comments. You can then choose to HELP these very intelligent animals just like you said! 
Hope you can learn about these animals true nature and you will be inspired :)"
You are totally right: 'a beautiful animal with staggering  intelligence.' You seem like a nice guy with a big heart! But this a NO...I don't support this kind of entertainment. 🙏
@nicolenriq @kristen.enriquez I forgot to tell you I took a picture with The Rock
@hannah.f.cox @sianold123

Is just the rock with no tattoos 😂😂😂
@dan_handley35 it’s a walrus
Ok bro we get it ur forearms are hyge
"Hi Dwayne! I’m a big fan of yours, and an admirer of your positive approach to life. You bring constant inspiration and I get a lot of encouragement (and also laughs) from your posts.

I’m very much against animals being kept in captivity, especially intelligent animals such as whales and primates. I’m a supporter of a nonprofit out here in Colorado called @wildanimalsanctuary  where we rescue large captive animals from all over the world, from situations including circuses and the entertainment/film industry. 
There is no justifiable reason for animals like that to be kept captive and forced to perform, and with modern CGI there is really no excuse for punishing them for our entertainment. 
I’m hoping, as a man with such a huge following and a voice that’s heard across the world, and as someone who appears to truly care for animals, that you can use your voice to better advocate for the animals in your industry. Though it may feel cool and look cool to work with those creatures, it’s significantly more cool to stand up for their welfare. I know you do so for children and I’m hoping you can do so for the animals as well."

Say no to animal captivity @leonardodicaprio @therock you can help this cause @dolphin_project @richardobarry lets work together
@_.matthewrussell
This post should be about how wrong it is to keep them captive, not about how you're going to put him in a movie. Disappointing!
I didn’t know anyone took a pic of me and the rock 🤷🏻‍♀️🤔
HEAR ME AND HEAR ME WELL YOU SO CALLED PEOPLE WHO SAY YOUR HIS FANS
Strong grip
@jeannetteebruno i worked in an aquarium for a year before, and I can tell you, this animals get treated anything but badly. And places like this do tins to help them. Do your research

Those poor whales are very depressed. Watch them swim circles in their tanks. Breaks my heart.
@veggie_boho
Poor animal
I wish we had no whales in captivity
@danrimington it’s not like if he doesn’t film all the whales in captivity will be set free. He’s also not saying he outright promotes that kind of stuff. If you were getting paid big bucks to partake in that movie, let’s be real, you would too. Stop trying to be a hero.
@sophiaamarchese ma è un bellissimo animale ahahaha
@marine_life_kayaker agree!! How disappointing  because I️ love him too!!
Beautiful animal
I love their sonar capabilities
@privateeyes78 if you are a minor, get out of here and stop trying to play with the big kids. But I think you are a 45 year old man baby. 🙅🏻‍♀️
Yes!!! Love this.
You are the same size as him
@chris_mitchell16 with all do respect, please enlighten me as to why there’s aquariums...? Does it do any good for some whales and wildlife? Would you want to be locked in a facility without the freedom to roam which is our nature? Just like it’s their nature? They don’t have a voice because they can’t talk so they don’t have any other option but to be forced and trained to entertain humans. We should be using our voices to help animals so they live the lives they were created to live.
Really a fan... but this... no no no.... it should be swimming in the sea 😩😢
You aren’t real

@therock we all thought you were smarter than this.. you need to educate yourself these beautiful creatures should not be stuck in a pool for your entertainment or to high five you or perform tricks! These animals should be free to live in the wild where they belong!  Be in awe of them there! Sort it out 😡

Did everyone one of you complaining about this animal and being free worry about the animal that once lived where your house, coffee shop or favorite mall is at now? Every building ever constructed has made many animals loose their life and their homes. Funny how we see this and get up and arms but animals are pushed out with every new building going up. You would have to stop living to truly let each animal live free.
I love youuuu

This beautiful animal with, as you say staggering intelligence deserves more than to essentially live in a bath tub. Be in awe of them whilst they live their lives happily in their natural environment. Sea life does not fair well in captivity 😔

@melylugo24  que animal es ese ?
I cant believe you would support such a thing, these aquariums should be shut down, the aninals belong in the wild, not in confinement for our entertainment
Am a very big fan of yours but as a human that respect all creatures you should set an example and not support a life locked in a swing pool when they should be out in the ocean having a descent life rather than waiting to be fed by someone if they do a good show or do as they are told. There is more to say but I believe you will get my point

@daniel.cuello  ma...ma...the rock non ha paura del Beluga magico!!! 😱 lui può tutto in effetti
Beluga whales are  indeed awesome. Aquariums are so not, tho.
He's allot bigger than @kevinhart4real to and can probably get more pops in the theater.
🔥☠️👌💪🏽
so cute
Wow it's wonderful

Beautiful!!!!

Did u just punch it in the chest?.... #rockabusesanimals
Beautiful Beautiful Beautiful !!!
@danieldore317 not necessarily. That would be based on training. But yes, there is a huge difference. Domesticated animals are bread with domesticated traits. Please, do some googling. I see that the education system wherever you live is severely lacking.
Please don’t support
@program_yourself so cute
📸😍
Everybody crying on this post. Cuz the rock got a pic with a animal 😥🐸
@coolman_coffeedan wtf 😂😂😂
🤩🤩🤗🤗
@kattalack195 The child molesters who married 11 year olds in biblical times, and wrote the Bible, have stated in scriptures that humans have dominion over animals. So their indoctrination is too deep to penetrate until they go looking for answers. They don’t understand the wrong in it. But most likely their children will see, so everything will be okay. Wild animals shouldn’t be in cages. We know that.
So beautiful
I love you Rock! And go to the aquarium and have fun with your family. It’s not something I’d do but that’s my choice and you going is yours. What I do ask though is don’t promote it and encourage others to go. If you did research into these aquariums you would see that these animals get taken from their homes to be stuck in much smaller overcrowded tanks. It’s just so sad 😭 thanks to these posts all your followers are going to go to This place and feed the need to steal from the ocean and imprison more marine life.

I love Beluga Whales! And that other animal in the picture is quite majestic 😉
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Hit that whale with the peoples elbow 🤨
Waoooo😱😱😱
@therock .. you are all that is good and brings light to the world.. except in the shadow of this post. You clearly have the heart of a champion and love animals, please take the time as a knowledge seeker to learn about the impact of captivity on these animals and the money machine behind it. Please continue to use your celebrity and status for a cause, not just for applause. You are human and are humble to let us join your life under the microscope, any picture could draw ire your way from zero intent, which must be impossible to manage. But the recovery from the moment through knowledge you can manage with heart and grace.
Should not support this torture
eu e @mariia_alicee
New Ace Venturer in the making.....
@danieldore317 yeah but 1. Belugas get free food in the wild when they want and how they want it 2. The ocean is a free place to stay where they came from and 3. A lot of animals taken from their families or communities don’t necessarily like it. I’m not really super against people having animals in sea world or whatever but you should know what you’re talking about before you say so
@iamstillrunning he is literally the coolest

❤❤❤
You're always doing movies with majestic animals. I admire you.
Yuck, promoting these intelligent water animals in captivity, defiantly lost some respect for you.
I ❤️Belugas!
@bewarmers Not anymorr

Dope 🙃🙃🙃
@ccarmemedeles

@matthew7jarman10 typical uneducated response.
Please @therock do not support animal cruelty.. animals should be free, not in an aquarium. You are the best! Please show the best things to do to the rest
Hermosa foto, nos inspira a cuidad nuestra naturaleza regalo de Dios
Mylove 😍😍😍💜💜💜😍😍😍💜💜💜

This photo is awesome. I heard from a movie that a beluga has the most powerful pair of glasses. @therock 👓💪 meaning they can see things from a far distance.
@shayna_rae18 this could’ve been you! Lol

This is so sad, so sad that you are promoting animal cruelty. Shame on you.
@mrchristiancage scroll through and you’ll see @therock and you are in the minority here.
@tarakatex what I hope my 4head looks like vs what my 4head actually looks like
@ashleynocera can you please replay to me
Aww, cool man!
Really hope this animal isn't kept in a tiny shit tank away from it's natural habitat for people's amusement and Hollywood productions.
Amazing!!!! I'm sure the Georgia Aquarium loved the opportunity to meet you and show you all the great things they do for public education and the conservation of these beautiful animals!!
@phoenix_oxo
This is disappointing to see the @therock doing this sort of film. The captivity of these amazing whales is brutal & barbaric #emptythetanks
Love this pic😍😍😍
😢what is WRONG with YOU Dewayne?!!! Seriously SMH!
@murraysimo16 @harrym1707 look it’s ME
So cute❤❤
So you’re in GA?????? And I haven’t gotten to meet you? Absolutely shattered
I see a lot of people hated this picture dont worry about them maaaan we all know you are a very good person by the way i just watched Rampage what a great move congrats 🤟👍💪
Look at this guy, trying to punch a beluga? That’s messed up sir.
This ones for the wank bank
Keep captive a beautiful animal like this is definitely nothing I would support....sorry, Dwayne #emptythetanks
#armtheanimals
Dolphinetly a good fit
Aquarium = jail 😢👎😭
Belugas are the coolest!

Please reconsider. This animal should be free.

@jujuatheart_ youre an idiot. Leo flew his giant private jet to talk about pollution and shit. Hypocrisy at its finest. A lot of celebs do it because it looks good, not because they care.
My favorite... Sorry!..the beluga whale!!! 😍😍😍😍😍
😍😍😍😍👌
So awesome!
As you said, is a beautiful and intelligent and awesome animal. And need freedom not sadness
Eu Amo q foooofuuuu💞
Booo!! Keeping whales and dolphins in captivity is pure evil! You’re better than this, Dwayne!
Beluga Whales Are The Nicest Creatures Ever
@ethans.animal.photography yes it is heavy with propaganda but I've also done my own research, they do touch on some Facts that no matter how you spin it are still facts. How about YOU educate YOURSELF on the topic
“Baby beluga in the deep blue sea”
me and my dad
@fedexterr me lo regali tu?
@tayology_
fuck aquariums tho
Very bad move therock! Those animals should be free not in captivity!
Beautiful animal indeed!!!
😗
Big show bout to win. Golden globe in that costume
@mrchristiancage yeah let others live. Except not whales.
@kerinew11 the Rock bringing back the cargos
@da_slowkid
@handsomerobby FYI these aquariums do hunt. They may not hunt and kill instantly but they hunt, snatch young from their mothers before they have chance to get imperfections or scars, so they look perfect for the visitors, then reduce them to a lifetime of suffering. Marine mammals are highly emotionally intelligent and suffer a life of captive misery, suffer from depression and have been known to self harm by ramming themselves into the tank through pure despair. It’s harmful and damaging to wildlife welfare and populations to support these cruel attractions.
😍😍😍😍
dope
Beautiful animal
No no no Dwayne. These animals shouldn’t be kept in captivity and you certainly shouldn’t promote it. So disappointed. 💔😭

So not cool!
👌👍
Yes it is beautiful
Looks like its puckering up for a kiss
❤️
@hiitsashmarie do some research
💙
@shannon_silveira And you call the Georgia Aquarium bad? You just stared an uneducated opinion that will KILL HER. She was not born in the wild she was born under human care. She is not adapted to the ocean. She is not adapted to hunting, pollutants, germs, and the other creatures in the ocean. So it’s pretty selfish to set her free when the facts show she will die a painful death
FUCK SEAWORLD. I can't believe you've posted this 😣😣😣😣 glad to see so many people who are knowledgeable about this commenting about how bad this post is. @therock
@evita_mlg7 jajajajaaja dioooo, algún día hermana!😜❤️

@gerry.cassidy.14 I look like the rock
@therock easy there buddy, 2018 is not ready for this level of awesomeness. Pace yourself...
Wonderful creatures that are kept in captivity against their will, then becoming depressed and aggressive. So can't we just free them instead ? They have to leave in big spaces, and live and chase food like any wild animal.
Love the rock but this is not cool
That's a statue
Wonderful
😍😍😍
@hwk7
It’s too bad they’re forced into captivity.

@ajc_4xo dory
Belugas our favorite ! My son Nick is autistic and didn't speak till he was 4, we took him to the NY aquarium  and he got to go see the beluga whales up close and Beluga was his first word and favorite sounding word. The whale was kind to him and made him laugh and smile. Now my son is 27 and he is a big Rock fan. We recently saw Skyscraper and Rampage- you had him at the edge of hi seat through  both movies !
Aweee. 😍😍😍🤗🤗🤗
@lilian_pumpernickle you’re a fool.
Why are you so awesome??? 😥😥😍😍@therock
lol... your dad joke...
Put it back in the ocean, this is cruel
@incirclesdtm do they love you or shelter, free food and water?
Such a great animal
@amyle07 just leave 🤦🏼‍♂️
Aaawwwww so beautiful creature that’s Mother Nature almost bring me to tears everytime touch my heart so deeply

that's cute

I usually like to stay out of this because people are ignorant. But Georgia aquarium is a non profit devoted to raising awareness and preserving our oceans. Most of the animals in aquariums end up here because of injury and cannot be safely released into the wild even after rehabilitation. So do your research and quit hating on the man. He’s a rockstar.

@therock Animal captivity is wrong. They must be protected but in their natural habitat. Help us end it! Do not support aquariums or zoos. Its just business using public money.
@b_trice23 😢so sweet
They are beautiful and we are happy The Rock is in Hotlanta!!!
This is cruel. If you had any ounce of respect for these animals you would use your platform to set them free.

Yes, and they should be in the open ocean, never in captivity. Time for a consciousness shift. It was probably taken from it’s momma as a baby to spend its entire life in a tank. 😞 #emptythetanks

Very beautiful.
I agree, these animals should be where they belong,the sea! But... where else can people be educated about those wonderful animals... Not everybody can aford to go into the sea to visit those animals to get their education there...
@nassim_dude  مادامك  عرفتها شكون  هي تسما واش الفرق بيني وبينك
Someone who has the influence that you do, and reaches so many people, should do some research on how these animals are affected, both physically and mentally, being held in captivity. It's such a disappointment to see someone people relate to so much encouraging this #blackfish

Disappointing that you appear to supporting captivity of an animal in this way when so much of the world are turning their back on these supposed ‘theme’ parks such as Sea World. I love your films, but use your fame for good! #maketherightdecision @waterbabyblonde
That dap tho
You'd be even in more awe @therock, if you saw them in the wild.  Imagine if you were kept in a box and people paid to see you do a few tricks... (which is kinda what happens now). Perhaps rather than saying how awesome it is, you could use your awesomeness to say how disturbing it is.

@emil_jonsson if you own a dog, cat, or fish move along. Also, a lot of research is done to learn about these animals and how to save their lives in the wild. Not to mention some of these animals were saved by being brought to these aquariums/zoos/sanctuaries.

@fchili22 they live a pretty darn good life missy.
disappointed! Maybe you need to see more, how those beautiful animals were kidnapped from their families. It is really sad that you are using your fame to support those terrible places. I think your ego is bigger than you.
@edagley7
It’s ur soul animal!
Not cool @therock don't support animals in captivity. It's wrong, pure and simple. Thankfully most people commenting agree with this. But yet these aquariums/zoos still exist 😒😔

@kattalack195 The beluga whale you see has already been domesticated genius, but I’m sure you probably thought it lived in the ocean and it’s now all of sudden ok playing with strangers.
Zuf I just got on my phone Kicked and saw the picture and I'm just back Furious 7 with the spot where Hobbs Elena from the exploded building has saved
Mentor 💪💪💪
Love belugas
What a great photo 🌟👍🏽
@nassim_dude nta mnin

@jmb_sospicy 😄too bad you couldn't be there with them
Utsukushī👏👏👏👏❤️❤️
What a magnificent mammal! Lucky you getting to this Beluga 🐋 Whale! ☺️
@therock. They are so beautiful.  Beluga Whales and Dolphins are two of my favorite!!! Great photo!!! Hope I can introduce my kids one day to these magnificent animals!!!!!
I'm kinda surprised that you'd condone animal captives. But, hey, most people don't understand that they're not smiling, they're begging for help.

Om-gee how awesome
@therock very Kardashian whale pic really disappointed in you. Makes no difference to you but I have to unfollow you know and I enjoy your normal posts. For me the pic is unacceptable and endorsers animal cruelty but also  you didn't reply to the criticism and stuck to the Instagram fire and forget for likes policy.
Que fofo
👊😎👊🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Que lindo
@awilks679 What can’t he do?
@dlipkin1 I want to do that too!
Awwwwww I love them
Cutest thing ever @emily_31x
@therock Noo u inspire me but I'm gutted to see u promoting cruelty. This Beluga is unhappy instead of use this animal why don't u speak up for it!! #voiceforthevoiceless #emptythetanks #thanksbutnotanks🐬🐋🐳
@th3author who gives a fuck
@evita_mlg7 aaaaii ❤️
@jujuatheart_ well he gets free food, a place to stay(for free), and doesn't have to worry about taxes so I think he's just fine.
@therock I’m surprised you’re not advocating for their freedom...
NO!!! Please don't be captivated by captivity! 💔😢
Aww cute ❤️
@valehm
Lindo coisa linda
Nice!!!

I adore this photo!!! Precious!!!😊💖💕💖💕💖💕💖💖💕💖💕💖💕💖
Disappointed. You should be on the other side with so many followers. Better make an anti-seaworld (and other whalepools) - post.

Bellissimo !!!!! Bell'idea per un nuovo film con un nuovo simpatico amico !
Shiny head ass

@fedexterr lo voglio. ❤️
Free that poor whale 🐳
@therock these are my favorite in the world! I call them lumpies!
@therock kind of gutted right now to be seeing this. Didn't have you down as being into supporting this horrendous captivity. Unless of course this beautiful, intelligent creature is actually in a sea sanctuary and swimming as freely as was intended!!
Hi, I’m trying to start a new fitness account and would really appreciate it if any of you reading this followed me, It would be beneficial to you and to me, thx💪

Sorry dude. I'm a massive fan and your genuinely an inspiration to so many people. But you're better than this man. If they can cgi a fifty foot gorilla they can do without using captive animals.

Poor animal. No freedom, but yet very few can see how sad this is for the animal kept against its will.
@margbarnard 💙
The dolphin played paper, and "The Rock" played rock, life is crazy
That's awesome!!

Dwayne, big fan here from Toronto. So sad for this creature. Captivity, tricks and amusement for humans? No thank you. Please use your wonderful influence to raise awareness. ❤️
@casper0810 Brandy 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 How are we both gonna marry The Rock and we are both married...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 We need to get off this post lolololol

@tank.sinatra lmao
@therock solar plexus punch!? 👊☠️😂
Yo The Rock, a bit more time delving deeper into the needs and traits of these animales and a bit less time at the gym; you’ll be able to peer into their misery. Time to prove that staggering intelligence of yours.
Yes. Amazing, so beautiful seeing it kept in a tank instead of being free in the sea.
Haha. Nice
Beautiful and intelligent, so why held in captivity ?

Amazingly beautiful animal!!! Nice Photo!  Chill out people... Let The Rock enjoy his time there.  And if you feel so strongly about the animals not being in captivity then you all go do something about it.  It sounds like there's enough people on here that can make an impact. The Rock can't do everything to please everyone even if he wanted to.  Good luck 😉
Beautiful
@john_eisner I WANT ONE!!!
@liquid8fire lmao!!!!
Wow
@therock I agree with many others here who have encouraged you to check out the #emptythetanks movement and films like The Cove and Blackfish. While I do believe the staff at the Georgia Aquarium truly love these animals, it's just not possible to keep such large, sentient, family oriented creatures in captivity and do them justice. In the wild they live in pods and travel thousands of miles. Being locked in a concrete tank with a few other belugas and human care takers just doesn't cut it.  You are an incredibly influential presence. I think it's unfair to yell at you if you weren't previously aware, but if nothing else, the reactions to this post should make you reexamine this choice and get more informed.
Meu sonho 😍🐬
2 best things in the world
@therock. I heard your running for Ambassador to the 7 seas in 2020? Can you confirm or deny?
☝👑🐬🔝👏😍
Sad to see someone I liked as a celebrity condoning and supporting animals in captivity 😞
Rampage2 the Beluga of a life time
Free willy remake, starring the rock
And what would what be even better is if we let those in captivity back in to the wild, it's 2018, this shit shouldn't even be remotely legal nevermind a means of entertainment.
Beautiful❤❤❤

Sí cool bro
Sooooo coooooL
Are you kidding? Maybe instead of pumping out movies faster than internet spam you might consider spending some time picking up a book or two/educating yourself on animal cruelty and whales in captivity. This is so tasteless and disappointing, wow.
The rock..Dwayne wale😂😂
@rafeskidmore
The Beluga Whale just met The Rock , what a lucky lad 😩
Lighten up people, this animal at an unusual color, may not have eve survived in the wild. How do you expect to teach about these animals and learn how take care of them. You can only do so much with a picture. Marine biological sciences have to learn things to save them. For example; If a dolphin gets caught in a fishing net or it's mouth caught in a plastic 6 pk rings. We have to know what to do for them.
Why would you think it’s ok to visit an animal held in captivity like this??? Really Disappointed
Wow wow that is so cool🌊 keep doing what you are you are the best.

@therock  love you but this is really disappointing. This is not cool. These creatures are not happy to be living in a bath tub.  Please dont promote  shit like this #emptythetanks
@ashleynocera really? A captive animal, far far away from its natural life - kept in a tank for our entertainment. Yeah.... Adorable ... Watch blackfish. #fuckcaptivity

@therock you probably didn’t know man, but read up on this stuff it’s a cruel industry you shouldn’t want to be a part of. Use your voice for the better man. Help those animals.
@emmetclohessy will you buy me a whale
Came here to see what the response was... am not disappointed. So pleased to see so many people calling you out @therock and letting you know this is not okay. They don’t belong in those bath tubs. Please correct yourself

@danrimington Hahahha. I’m so offended hahaha 😂😂💩
@theabbies Georgia aquarium
The baluga whale ... they are awesome
That’s why the right place for a highly intelligent animal is out there in the sea where it can roam free and use it’s intelligence to the fullest. Don’t you think? Not aquarium. Not doing trick for human amusement. I feel sad seeing this photo.
STOP CAPTIVITY!!!!!! Why the fuck is this being praised
Wow👍👍👍
Kraağğll
Cool
Finally. Someone who works out more than the rock 😆😉
Uau
@therock it looks like you just decked the whale in the chest & its flying backwards
@therock of course you are there right after we went.. would of been nice to meet you- my boys would of love to meet you!  Isnt @georgiaaquarium amazing??
@therock too intelligent to be trapped in an aquarium :(
king 👑👑👑
Jahahahaha savage
I really need The Rock to meet my brother Mike, he has had a stroke his kidneys have failed and he is on dialysis 3 days a  week has been turned down for a transplant and his time is limited. He really wants to meet Dwayne and if he is in Atlanta I will pay whatever it takes to get my brother to meet him. CAN SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME? I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE I CAN DO!
♥️♥️♥️
Wow! So cool!
@steel_megnolia yum… let me know if he’s still there tomorrow!!
@tania_tango  I met the rock today 🙄😂
@therock please tell me you recorded you singing the Raffi Baby Beluga song?!
@therock I always admired you - but please do not support this cruelty! These intelligent creatures are kept in an environment that is not their natural habitat - they are miserable and depressed! You are smarter than this 💪🏽❤️ #boycottcaptivity #animalabuse #cruelty

@therockoffcial_ Probably easier to get along with than @kevinhart4real
@dbucc99!!!!
@danieldore317 Is this sarcasm because obviously I haven't asked the whale. My comments are based on researched facts of these creatures in captivity.. proven again and again.  But it's not just the rock that has shocked me tonight but also there are people like you that comment like that.
Well @kevinhart4real I think we’ve found your replacement 🤨😂
Pretty sure that whale is racist... He's white so he must be right?
My mom works at the EIA (environmental investigation agency) where they help animals from going extinct or endangered and she is trying to get people to help beluga whales. ;)

All these fake animal activists criticizing The Rock (who is a person of color) and talking about animals in captivity aren't saying a damn thing to Donald Trump about the children he has in captivity or the unarmed POC who are abused and/or killed by law enforcement every day. Fuck all of you. Most of you have pets at home. How about YOU set THEM free, bitch.

@therock captivity kills. Educate yourself on this industry. These whales are beat and abused ... stolen from their family’s all for human entertainment. Don’t support this rock.
@marioloipold thank you 🙏🏻 and yes, it is! nobody should support this Aquarium cruelty shit
@leonardodicaprio have a word
Oh my god that is the most cute whale or ugly human I’ve ever seen 😂❤️
Looks like his/her head is almost as big as yours😂😂😂
@jujuatheart_ in closing, I get it. It’s abuse to the whales and the dolphins I’m against it too. However the rock didn’t put them there. My point is it’s easy to say this and that but people need to help not just talk. What I said still stands, you are British it still applies, do you concern yourself with your fellow countryman that are homeless?
Wow wonderful
Meu amor! Que lindo te amo .
Awwww so cute❤❤❤❤❤

@jesuissaraho ok, but I'm hoping it's a remake of over the top, and the beluga is cast as his son....
Bailey!!!!!!!
Very disappointing you find this acceptable.

"I wish you paid those aquarium jerks some money out of your million dollars to take this poor captivated creature back to where she belongs.
That would have been a much respectful post than acting like another tourist next to this sweetheart! 
Use the place where you are for betterment of the world probably?"
Jeez all these people talking about animal cruelty I'm sure you all are great citizens of society and do everything humanly possible to save the environment. Lighten tf up.

I love you @therock but I cannot support wild animal captivity, especially aquariums, they are notorious for being awful for sea animals, watch #blackfish on #netflix its a sad existence for thee beautiful creatures!
❤ !!
Your son looks different here
Same head shape too 🤔🤣
#captivitykills please do not support the captivity industry
Aww this makes me sad. They belong in the wild not in aquariums nor in movies.
Wow so beautiful❤🐋🐋🐋,💙
Beluga should not even have a contact with humans. Should be free with its own species. If you love and understand something let it be. I had an marine aquarium and when I realised whats behind that industry I refused to keep going with it
😍
@carmen_eliza31 yesssss

@georgiagirl07 awwwwww yes haha good times!! Miss you!!
I’m a huge fan! But I don’t support this at all. These animals are drugged and kept in extremely small tanks to try and entertain people. I can’t support this

HONESTLY a man of your stature should really NOT be promoting such cruel and unjust ‘so called’ ENTERTAINMENT, Which is not only harming such magnificent creatures but also funding acts of animal cruelty the world over. Sorry this is not acceptable. Especially from one of the the most influential men in film and entertainment today."
@mango_anthony wow 😍😊
She should be free.

@griselgamarra not when they are hurt/injured and can't survive in the wild which is where the animals at the Ga Aquarium come from.

@official_edna_mode There are areas of the ocean that are watched over so that animals can live in peace. I see where you are coming from and I respect it is a place of concern for these animals. Right now they're working to get some safe spots set up to keep Belugas safe. If this happens and can be properly monitored, it would wonderful if we never had to cage an animal again. Let's hope it is sooner than later. Of course, I understand some animals that have been captured would not survive the same if released to the wild, so they are keeping this in mind. If you'd lile to learn more or how you can help Google "Beluga safe zones, Beluga conservation, Beluga rehabilitation, etc."
@tef48 my man? Its better that the animal chills in the pool than being eaten up by a shark or another fish lmao stupidass
@clairemcconnell it’s an honour to be co-starring with the rock!
Il faut surtout les remettre en liberté et qui ne soit pas dans des bassins ridicules

You’re in Ga. wanna come over for dinner. 😂. I don’t cook, but we can order out
And it lives in a closet relatively speaking.  Need to free these animals.  The nature shows are amazing now.  They would be better off in the wild.

Please please please do not support captivity of mammals like beluga whales , orcas or dolphins (or any such species for that matter)... I urge you to watch „the cove“ and „blackfish“ ... they don’t belong there and most certainly are unhappy in their unnatural habitat . @therock .. we need People like You to support their freedom .

This is a real shame, I’m gutted. It was nice while it lasted @therock, fare well.

@jjchaves Whales are grouped into two groups. Some have teeth, others a baleen. A simple inquiry on Google would enlighten you. Nevertheless, Beluga is a type of Whale.

Recognized the Beluga reference to last month's maiden voyage of the #Airbus’ BelugaXL; featuring a painted whale face and striking resemblance to your new co-star . The new super-transporter is one of the largest aircraft in existence but rather comical in appearance! Now we'll think of your photo everytime the massive creature hits the sky!

@yves_valera @portis77  Pablo y yo
@dparson24 you also know that there are open sea sanctuaries that do the same but whiteout the animal being used for entertainment or being forced in an inclosure that's way to small for them right ? Do your research before bashing someone for wanting these animals to have the freedom they deserve
You’re such a nice guy even the whales love you.

Beautiful!
Yo, I tried to give you the benefit of the doubt and looked up the aquarium to see if maybe it was a better one that only took animals that couldn’t be reintroduced to the wild, but they were actually ranked the FOURTH WORST aquarium in North America in 2016, for their death toll of Beluga whales and their disregard of the health of marine animals by shipping them across the nation. They are in fact incredibly intelligent creatures, which is why they sure as shit don’t belong in captivity for our entertainment.

Wow, I love Beluga!!😍
@emily_john99 💁🏻‍♀️💅🏻💅🏻
@bthstwrt Why is he so perfect? 😭😭😭
@mis.lys  WE MISSED HIM
Dude, I love you, but take a good look at how these super intelligent guys are being kept and whether it's a healthy, stimulating environment for them. Someone with your influence could make a big change to their lives.
@_saraheree a white beluga whale 😍
Okay brozam, if I may call you #brozam. That's a cool dolphin you're posing with I had one of those real feeling dreams with a whole pool full of assorted dolphins and that was the smart one in the back talking to me telepathically. I woke up and learned all about beluga whales online. they really are the smartest
RAMPAGE 2. Electro beluga-loo
If Dwayne Johnson swims and he doesn't sink, is he really the rock??? @therock
@torifields8 nooooo that would’ve been awesome!!!
@pascalthebold whales are the best animals don’t @ me

Love everything you do except seeing animals held captive 🙏🏻 your fame and presence could do so much for animals.
@robbmillerr you could meet your fav animal! 😂
It’s unfortunate that you saw the whale in an aquarium and not in the ocean 🌊
Das ist so schön ✌💙💙💙💙💙👍
You should ask him how many of his buddies they've killed🤔#captivityKILLS 💔🐋
@c.a.t.m.o.o.r.e 😍

Possibly the most amazing picture I've ever seen!

Why are you punching that beluga whale?
You can never hate this guy.  The haters are dead busy trying to bring him down but he's anti-Hater Free so they won't bother him.
@danrimington so sad we are still using prisoners for entertainment
No me gusta. Detesto que lucren con los pobres animales, las cosas que le habrán hecho para que llegue a hacer eso la pabrw ballena, golpes, dias sin comer, gritos. Horrible
Fabuloso hay expectacular
Gorgeous.
Wow!  Great picture!
There is enough on tv and the internet now... you don't need to shake a fin or stare at it behind glass to learn

@dforesta lol
Rock:hi, how are you?
@alanathomas
Beautiful 😍😍
I want you daddy
Uou
That beluga must be terrified, it’s face-to-fist with The Rock
@danrimington why? Because we can and animals are entertaining as fuck. We happen to be the dominant species so we get to do what the fuck we want. Kill animals for fun, yep. Eat defenseless animals, yep. Put them in movies for our entertainment, yep. If they don’t like it fight back. Oh wait they can’t because humans run this shit!!!!
👏👏👏👍👍👍👍
A real shame you have posted this. When you are looked up to by so many people and have good values. Please re consider.

@ronaldohoxha_ I was thinking this😂
@therock I would have expected your support for wild animals, living in the WILD rather than secluded in an enclosed and sad aquarium #boycottaquariums
the Rock and other icons, like Arnold, motivated me to start trainig. check out my progress on IG 🖐🖐🖐

Oh no @therock Why would you support this I thought you was a decent guy clearly not 😑 empty the tanks!!!
That's awesomeness
I'm heartbroken you're promoting this! You were one of my favs. Please, please,please do some research on animals held in captivity like this. I promise you'll never endorse this again.
Wow so hawt
Looks like you had a....... Whale of a time.......
Yes daddy
She deserves freedom

Wow Mashallah
Good VIBES ✌

@rachellvallori hi
@tylerlandon_  from the moment he enters the park..he is supporting captivity..sorry but thats a fact! if he wants to see those beautiful creatures..he should go to iceland or elsewhere... to see them in the wild...and not in a fucking tank!
cool!!!
Not cool @therock
Powerful energy 💥💥💥💥
Wow....
@al_board Girl I have a story about this. Remind me to tell you when I see yoy
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
@therock Rampage 2 the swimquel
@gratewhyte I’ve seen it
Id much rather if you didn't support such animal attractions. Please educate yourselves. This animals life span would be cut to 1/3rd. They suffer depression, yearning for freedom, longing for  their life to be their own and not for vain people who paid to see them jump through hoops. Like this is normal behaviour for wild animals?! People are waking up. #shame @therock  that you're not part of it. Unfollowed.
Awesome
Really really shocked you support this

So sad...😢 Cannot believe that you're supporting this
He is taller than Kevin Hart so that’s something...
@jesus__dlt that's why I also mentioned the open sea sanctuary which is a sanctuary in the open sea big enough for it to fully swim free, it has a inclosure so that the animals that can't be fully in the wild anymore  still have the freedom they deserve whiteout having to entertain the masses an be locked up an depressed ...those places have animal care workers to make shore the animals are an stay healthy...there being looked after an most of them are closed for the public or open to small groups a year where people can watch them from a far an still learn about them whiteout the animals being harmed in any way....
@kirsten_strom I can't. I cannot.
In a tank
@marine_life_kayaker niiicceeee.. now THATS how we should be treating our fellow mammals
I love dolphins because they are the angels of the sea

It’s true, @therock isn’t physically putting this animal in the tank, but his support of it supports the organizations that do. Please, watch #thecove or #blackfish and educate yourself. Please, #emptythetanks
Hope his echo location is working...
❤ it's cute
Ahhh I can’t believe you’re in Atlanta!  I want to meet you 😢
So beautiful!
Omg, Such a Great and Amazion Photo - it does look like a scene from your next Movie 🎥
@ijustine how
Beautiful animals in captivity because they’re endangered in the wild. Soon all we’ll have left is photographs in books/magazines and the internet. So sad 😞
Wow really awesome pic 😍👍
#fail @therock No movie pay check is worth promoting these beautiful creatures in captivity. Sad to see you supporting this man 👎
@thomas_l94 @joelloj @mayuko143 *uuuuuhhhh ich sehe* 😂😂😂
@therock I sure hope this is a CGI dolphin man. It’s 2018, don’t you think it’s time to let the animals retire from the acting business. You’re a very likeable person, but this picture 👎boooooh👎 also 15 min after I finished watching Rampage again. Which is👌😮
@jazmine9019 Jesus Christ I’m not reading all that
سبحان الله العظيم الذي لا اله الا هو لقل للشئ قل فيقول
https://www.georgiaaquarium.org/conserve/research/beluga-whales  Yes it sucks that animals are sometimes kept in captivity and sometimes in the most appalling and inhuman ways. However did any of you stop and check like I just did to see what the Georgia aquarium are actually doing with the whales?! They are a near threatened species, sometime just sometimes animals are safer in captivity and can be monitored so in the long term they can help other whales in the wild, so that this species of whale isn’t wiped out by predators in the ocean.
❤️❤️❤️
Noooo that beautiful intelligent animal belongs in the ocean! Free!!!!
😍😍😍😍😎
This is so beyond heartbreaking😭 Poor baby
Meu Deus que lindo. 😍😍😍

Lindo animal.
@choda19a
@therock hi from Croatia( a small country withouth a big (only dolphins) sea mammals. But pls watch Blackfish or The cove documentary movies. Make me proud and be against sea world parks. Those animals are not happy. They are very depressive and sad. Which is horrible for creatures more intelligent then us. God bless you.
@kellyevagelakos
so cute...
They feel like wet hot dogs! 🤗
If you know how intelligent he is, you should know that he cant be happy stuck in an aquarium and doing stuff he doesnt want to. Why do you support it?
Still bigger and better looking than @kevinhart4real

@privateeyes78 so caring about animals means your a hippie does it? Jeeez - sort your judgemental self out 😂😂😂
"How to shit a career and fans down a toilet by the @therock

All the negativity in here is terrible yes its wrong to put these amazing animals in these evironments but hes not the one doing it to them or funding the capture of them hes just sharing a post with a beluga @therock i got your back brother
It’s sad that all of you found a way to turn this picture into something negative, you all are acting as though the rock put this animal in the aquarium.  You want to change the world that’s great! Do it on your own pages let people post in peace.
Did the rock just catch a whale? What can’t he do?!
Oh come on man. You gotta know this is wrong....

You are a legend @therock but this is seriously disturbing. These amazing animals deserve better.

@therock So disappointed to see this. Please research how most of those beautiful, intelligent, social creatures are acquired. Research the differences of their life spans in captivity vs. in the wild. Research the daily stress they endure for human entertainment. If you knew more, you wouldn’t be there, much less smiling about it. #EmptyTheTanks

#georgiaaquarium is one of my favorite places ever!! ❤️🐬🐳🐋
@therock today you take a step backwards. You are endorsing the slavey of this sentient being. You just described how intelligent they are, now have some empathy and imagine how it must feel to be caged? As intelligent as they are, they are surely aware they are prisoners in a fish bowl... You make so much fucking money, you are the highest paid actor ever, so spend your money on ecotourism and have a positive impact and go see them in the wild or don’t see them at all! Furthermore, don’t use its suffering for your own financial gain. My grandma always told me you can always tell the character of a man by how he treats the less fortunate! Now you are planning to make money from a caged and intellectually aware animal, such a disappointing and cruel choice you are making. #fuckgeorgiaaquarium #fuckseaworld

Tell me Rock please how animals being taken from their mothers when young get put into 1 of these things for the rest of their life then when they suddenly act out they're the ones that are crazy? What if the role was reveresed and you were in a box for your entire life? Say the samething then just cause we're the dominant species doesn't mean thats a good thing 🤦‍♀️
Más lindo a mi también me gustan los delfines mi grandote hermoso 😘😘😘

Hurts my heart to see a man with so much influence and intelligence support the awful animal abuse and torture that allowed this wild sentient animal to broken and trained for human exploitation 💔 look into the slaughter and dolphin drives at 💔 #taiji

Whoaaaaa @everyonecommentingonthis lets tell him how we feel in a positive way, let’s suggest if he loves them fight for them!! @therock is a great human! If he values this interaction, then even more reason for him to fight against it!! @therock this is a huge piece in the animal cruelty industry, if you loved meeting him, and you understand how intelligent they are, then you know he’s better off in the wild. He knows he’s a prisoner and you know he’s too smart to be in a box 💕 help !

Is that real? 😂
Rock meets whale
I love beluga whales. They always look like they are smiling 😊
@sadie_bethany this is so cool
@graceecopp
نفس صلعتك يبو روك😂🙅
Yay! That aquarium is awesome! And the belugas enjoy watching the people that mop the outside of their tank, it's so cute!
Oh my GOSH. Beautiful indeed!
Win
@pragyaabrol leggooooo
@emilyskyefit the whale’s quite cute too! 😜
Not happy about this shocked you would support this kind of thing wonderful intelligent creatures kept in small pools to amuse the masses 😥
😍😍😍
Disappointed! @therock
J
Awsome pic
@therock man, you should not be giving these places this type of attention, spreading the message the wrong way
Wow Beautiful!
Omg it’s cute
So cool!! Love you!!
nice
It only does that because it was starved and isolated in a dark tank until it complied... Please make steps to not support this abuse.
@jujuatheart_ so you haven't asked the whale how it feels, so you're assuming everything, which means your entire argument is based on assumption. Hmmm.
Dios aprieta :v
@therock DID HE/SHE ATTEMPT THE PEOPLE’S EYEBROW WITHOUT THE BROW? 🐬
:( sad
@gicavallari HAHAHAHAHA the rock com a beluuuu
@melobits85 I don't have his window... I'm gutted he's promoting this to millions and if I could promote my views to millions I would.  Every celebrity brings on comments from people all over the world.  I will not hush because you've told me to.  Read through and you'll find hundreds of others are skiing the same,  he has hit a raw nerve with thousands not just me
People saying don't support animals in captivity and animals are not for entertainment. Yet their Instagram is filled with pics of their leashed dog doing something so sweet and funny!  Lol. #FreeYourPet
That’s such a good photo!!
Wow amazing
Remake the raffi baby beluga video!!!!!
My favorite whale love them
@lucasway 😍😍😍😍 take me here
Wow that’s COOL!💜❤️💙💖🌺🌸🌻💋
You sir, are currently living my lifelong dream rn😂🐋⚪️
Hope the Beluga Whale behaves for you, & not squirt blast you like it happened to me 30yrs ago (got blasted 3 times on the same day at the Vancouver Aquarium).
Wow 😍😍😍
Was ein süßes Vieh @horbaczino
@vsouham Oooh
Oh noooo really you say it yourself in your comment “staggering intelligence” unbelievable..... these animals DO NOT deserve a life in captivity.... please please do not support this cruel entertainment💔 #sodisaapointed  #notafan
Wow
👏👏👏
Set him free. @therock 🐳👍❤️
@kckearns why am I into this?
Man, could you leave any animal to work with?? You already have @kevinhart4real ....btw she is so young and beautiful ..@therock lots of love to you man ...keep it up and keep surprises us .... Good luck
@megan_elliottt looks like him
Dissapointed 😥
@rihab_lassir
@jujuatheart_ saying
You just lost a fan. These animals shouldn’t be in tanks. They should be in the wild. No Aquarium can compare to the ocean. Educate yourself.
@shopbelugababy told you the rock loves you 👍😜
Unfollow. Disappointed. Not for our entertainment. #thecove #blackfish #emptythetanks

@therock  you gotta shake the fin brother lol
Yall are sensitive af
Good to see you and Vin made up
The beluga whale does NOT belong in a swimming pool .. it belongs in the open water - travelling for miles and swimming with its pod - you said your audience is who you listen to — so please please please listen to all the people on this feed - who are saying that’s this is NOT GOOD ... they do not belong in human swimming tanks!!
Omg save him and bring him to me 😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩
@amandaamarie21 look the beluga and you have the same complexion- pasty 😈😂
You shouldn’t be promoting animals like whales to be in aquariums, it’s disgusting

@therock omg we just saw Rampage and my little girl (4 yo) kept saying “Georgie please be ok” she enjoyed the movie and so did I.. we loved the end when he gave the finger then um... the other hand sign (👉🏼👌🏼) 🤣 #therocksays #knowyoureolegibroni #laytheamackdownonyourcandyass I’m an old fan...

I love you
YESSS!!! JUST BEAUTIFUL ❤❤❤
@danrimington I was looking for that one comment that will kill the mood
If your going to take a photo with me, at least tag me in it.
#whiteknight
Mr. Johnson, I implore you to reconsider supporting an establishment that has cetaceans on exhibit. Please do some research on how these animals are acquired and the tremendous stress they live under. They are social, family oriented and extremely intelligent. They need a whole ocean and their entire Ohana to be happy. 💖🐋🐋🐋💖
So Cute
Bad call here. You should not be supporting these disgusting places.
💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋

@kaevillanoy
😍😍😍😍
Quite same...but @therock has legs....
“Bro, do you even swim?!”
@maggierendon24 cant believe your getting to work with the rock in his next movie! 😩.... lol
@callshotguns Actually no. Watch the movie blackfish. A lot of aquatic animals are taken as young. Not the same as wildlife conservation
@therock I am not sure I understand what is cool, funny or interesting about animal in captivity for human entertainment. These are majestic animals that deserve to live in the wild and in their natural habitat. As long as we will keep promoting parks, zoos, aquarium, there is no reason for money makers to stop exploiting this business avenue. Keep it real, all the way!
Hold on. On my way to Atlanta!
Appalling @therock I’m out here!
Rampage Part 2
Luuuuuckyyyyy
@therockoffcial_ you have to be in a marvel movie soon or superhero in general or villian i know you would dominate my brother im just chasing my dream to make it to hollywood on tv and on movies your my Idol
When big stars like you make post like this it ruins all the hard work people are doing to try and free these animals. Need to stop posting shit like this
@parismarieward destiny... I know your talking about me
So sad to see this.
Empty the tanks! Animals deserve freedom and happiness and a life with purpose and fulfillment. They deserve the chance to have a family and socialize. You see how intelligent these beings are and yet you want to use them for your own personal gain.
Wow beauty 😍😍😍
Even baby beluga loves the rock! .
Awesome
I‘m very disappointed of you. I didn’t thought you would ignore animal suffering. Watch Blackfish, watch The Cove! Empty the tanks!!!!
@elliehulsex looks so fake 😂😂
No sign language with this whale? Only with George?
If you love them please use that for good and not for cages
One of the most majestic creatures on the planet, and a baluga whale.  Neat
Wow amazing
That Beluga should be swimming free--- I don't think it wants to be in Entertainment.
🔥🙌😘
💟💟💟💟
Sorry @therock but I can’t support this for me #Aquariums #zoos and @SeaWorld are places where animals are enclose to entertain humans and they don’t have freedom. That’s my my point of view. 😔
@marcusjhiry omg!!! It’s a Beluga whale!!!! 😩😩😩
Lindo
@emily_john99
Good
Mais serré la main à @therock oui sa serais un rêve! 👌☺️
"beluga whales who were stolen from their homes.
How can u support animals in captivity?"
Que fofo😍
Awsome pic 😍😍😍😍
Be prepared to be upstaged. He looks like a bit of a ham

Has anybody else noticed that you are almost as big as that whale 👀
@mikeytejeda1  it’s juke
😍😍😍😍
Kinda disappointed to see that, that animal should be free
Wow
Gorgeous! Albino?
Too bad it’s stuck in an aquarium instead of living in the vast ocean it belongs in. 😢
Cute and smart
Please don't promote this. @erniebusby any source to shed some light on how they are being treated under captivity? Please show
How long you in Atlanta for? I’d love to know if you’ll be anywhere to meet fans..
Not cool DJ... not cool
Imagine if Jason Mamoa met with Dwayne. That would be mind blowing.
@serramarc96 😂😂
Bro this dolphin met the rock, stfu about animal captivity y’all will probably never meet the rock.
ITS GORGE😮😮😮😮
❤❤❤
👍❤😍😊😁
Please do not support animal cruelty @therock you have so many people who look up to you, be a voice for the animals. This beautiful animal doesn’t deserve to be in a tank, you are better than this 😔
Free it, he’s not here to entertain us like some clown. Let him be happy
Looks like the one out of finding dory

Is that Quinu?!
@angle.1687 the rock is doing it right 😎
Please don’t use live, captive animals in your films. This intelligent creature doesn’t want to be held against their will and perform silly tricks for our enjoyment.
this is a blessed photo

@therock Seriously brother you've got to give your head a shake and check your values. Stick you in a cage and see how you like it.
coisa mais  linda😍
I can't believe you support this 😓 Empty the tanks!!! #blackfish #emptythetanks
@kroll8 eu tô morrendo aqui , vc não tá entendendo
@emilyskyefit yes they are beautiful creatures but this is not something to be promoting
Awesome @therock
Theyre awesome creatures!
They are such amazing beautiful creatures
captivity smh ...
@frederiqueguilbeault je l’ai fait sa à Niagara Falls! Hihi
They are very flirty.
What people are failing to understand is that these animals to may have been injured as youths meaning that they can no longer maintain lives in the ocean freely without being killed due to their lack of familiarity with their natural environment. These places may not be perfect, and i do not excuse animal abuse in any instance, they also rehabilitate and rescue some of these wildlife... but thats just my cup of tea
Amazing
Wow!

does it not make you angry that these animals are kept in captivity for your exploitation.
So awesome❤️
Sad it was probably stolen from its family in the wild 😪
Im so jealous I could cry 😭
Cool
Que hermosa Beluga!!! Las amo
@allannnnnnnnnm my BB
Ohhh ffs @therock  i was a fan untill this picture - next time your in your million £ house sipping your whisky may i suggest  u sit your arse down and watch blackfish  and the cove see if u think its cool then - very disappointed  in u @seashepherd
Nice THE ROCK
Amazing
He’s not living in the wild ocean so i don’t like that pic or you supporting that. Don’t get me wrong i really like you but such animals don’t belong in human cages.
😍
😂😂😂
😍😍😍😍😍
Fuck me, why the fuck would you endorse this. Lost all respect for you. This is animal abuse.
@therock Don’t you mean with staggering “central intelligence”? 😂😂😂😂😂
I was just there damnit
@allyson_green how many times have I gone there and never had an encounter with that gorgeous creature?? #notthewhale
@peejae_
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Belugas are awesome and our Zoos and Aquariums do amazing things to make sure they are all happy and healthy! Another reason why your rock! @therock
@recyc_ling weren’t you just there?
Omg! 😍😍
Nice foto ''my new friend''
😍😍❤❤
Do it! Next free willy! Break him out of the holding pool into the wild being protected 24/7 as he’s worth millions to poachers. Mad guns and shit 😂
@jujuatheart_ dude without promotions some ppl would never even know what they look like
@maria_dugalic 😂😂
Stupid photos like this and the whale shark one really put me off people and i love @therock. ☹️ So sad to see someone who could help make a change not see the bad in this. Someone tell me why these majestic animals are in a tank!!! The ignorance of some humans really does amaze me. Educate your brains at @dolphin_project
@geowro
@nickelsdove big difference between a domesticated pet and an animal kept in captivity. If you don't understand that you should go play in traffic

@arora_siddharth what ok😒
Beautiful
@binsatan dogs have been kept for so long so dogs don’t deserve freedom? Just admit that keeping dogs as pet is as selfish as keeping animals in the zoo. Dogs are cute and can be at service, but dogs need freedom too.

These magnificent creatures should not be in tanks. As much as I love watching you I’m disappointed 😞
@talithaprandini
So dope !
Omg you so ripped
Gee I hope you take time to read these comments. A big thumbs down to you promoting this. A beautiful intelligent creature who should be free not in an aquarium. 😡
@danrimington seriously with the black fish thing that was how many years ago? It’s not even close to that anymore . Do some research before opening you’re damn mouth 👄
Wooowww
I would hope you wouldn’t support keeping such animals in captivity
Wowwwww lovely 😍😍😍👍👍👍👍😘

@therock please take some time to research these mammals in captivity. Whales and dolphins are like you and me, the need space to roam and see how awesome the world is. Use your power to educate your fans and the world. You can help change everything for the better!
The rock is a mans man. I mean what Man U know stares at his next meal in the eye and shakes his hand! COME ON!!!
😍😍😍😍 Awwww
@saphirashirinbab18 @lindsay.j.c.a  leya hahahah

@mrchristiancage some people deserve to be judged. Nothing "sensitive" about caring about animals. In fact you seem like a huge loser for not caring. #byefelicia
Georgia aquarium has received big criticism for the conditions it keeps its dolphins/whales and whale sharks, in. Not a place you'd expect endorsed.

Disappointed you would advertise an aquarium let alone this one which has been controversial for its beluga program. Recently they tried to import wild caught beluga calves and juveniles from Russia purely for breeding and entertainment purposes. Unfollowing. #emptythetanks #captivitykills

No animals in captivity anymore. :/ Let's change this. Love your movies.
Imma big fan, but this is a bit disappointing. I feel like if you really had respect for this animal you'd be promoting it's freedom not it's likely fatal captivity.
Whale hello, nice to meet you. Are you touching me on Porpoise because if so then Whale have a problem.

@jessrwinters i saw this and thought so too
An albino whale too
start by introducing myself. I am Donald Hooper. I am married to a Colombian immigrant, (shes beautiful), and have a daughter, Nancy, who's 7, and a son, Donald Jr. I almost lost my life 4 years ago. I was terribly addicted to alcohol. I spent many days in the hospital over and over again. I couldn't stop. I lost my family. Long story short, I was able to get sober, and have rebuilt my life with all of them. We are both trying to get our private business going but need some help. We have been through so much, but still keep going. I am going to celebrate 4 years sober this year. I am activly involved in multiple community assistance programs. I'm a chef so I cook for people who are terminally ill. It's my way of giving back. I am a private chef. My wife is an artist and we own a retail online store called Hooper Creations. Plesse help us. We dont need money.  We need support please!! @therock #therock

Awesome
This is soooo not cool - can't believe you are promoting this  WTF?

Hey! I’m your next co-star remember? 🤷🏻‍♀️
@flynnpictureco right, so why wouldn’t we keep them against their will in captivity where they can lead an abnormal and cruel life!
Que envidia, 😍😍😘😘💖💖
They shave their heads too @therock #dadscomm

Animals like this are not meant to be in captivity. Not cool.
What !!! Terrible to see this 😢 dont support seeing these awesome beautiful creatures kept in a tank !!!! So sad 😡
This is terrible. Animal captivity is not a joke. They are not there for social media. This is cruel and heart breaking. Please get educated. Don't support animal prisons!
What’s the next movie?? 🎥

@dparson24  watch the part in black fish where they are netting the young at sea and dragging them away from their mothers #blackfish then you can open your mouth

This animal is too intelligent to be in captivity.. @therock. Disappointed @ this post bro.😟😟😟
If you love these creatures please don’t support their imprisonment. They’re not pets or cattle, they’re not built for confinement
@w_holdbrooks why have I not been here???

Nooo! @therock I love your vibe and am always down with your positivity, but whales shouldnt need to be stuck in those tiny fishbowls and endorsing that with your kind of platform is not okay.
@dawudrc this is spectacular 😍

You and the whale belong together
I watched central intelligence about 10 minutes ago and I saw this pic and got confused cause I taught I followed bob on insta
I love what you teach us about being yourself and following your truth, but this is really gross and disappointing seeing you in support of a place that imprisons animals. One could argue "aquariums" are to teach ppl about other animals and show us how amazing they are, but if these places were truly for animal welfare they wouldn't have animals on display or interacting with the public. It's such a tricky thing and I hope this makes ppl aware of the reality of captivity #emptythetanks #loveyou 😘🌎
When you want to fist bump but the other guy wants a hand shake 😂
It’s the energy that they feel through the air...
@ashs_91 i am that whale! 😏
You Rock!
FANTASTICA !! ❤️😘
@streetartglobe Kevin Hart is black @kevinhart4real
@ericstout37
Wow! Awesome.. I have built aquarium in korea. That was very wonderful experience. Like you..^^
@mrreddington77 yup the rock is cool that is fact. Another fact is people talking about aquatic animals captured for peoples amusement (big difference between that and conservation) spreads awareness. If one person  gets educated on the subject that's one more step to stopping it. Do you understand the concept of gathering the small hanging fruit first? Just because people aren't actively protesting doesn't mean they are standing idly by. Of course, unintelligent people can't quite understand that and just think everyone is "triggered" or a "liberal". Well sir, I'm more concerned about animals and our planet, not on political labels.

Only @therock can make a whale look small 💪🏽😂 @wravman13
The same animals that are held captive could suffer horrible deaths at the hands of slaughterers shortly after they are released. This is indeed a difficult time for people that live and care for animals. We have to police the great waters and stop the horrific crimes against them. Sometimes good intentions don’t always turn out good. If they could somehow cage off a large part of the great water for their protection that would be wonderful. I don’t complain because I am not in position to make the necessary changes yet. Don’t be hard on people that are trying to show love to even the ones living in captivity. Would it be better if everyone ignore them because of where they are? I pray that love brings together a group of good wealthy people that can challenge this issue intelligently and successfully.

As a lot of people wrote wild animals deserve something better than this. Honestly we’re in 2018 and you can make a movie with 3D animals, computer graphic and special effects like you already did. A man like you should promote the freedom of this creature and not the exploitation
Q belleza
@adelacastejon mira quien anda por aqui. Ejejej
Nooooooooooooo stay away- too smart for a bath tub
waaannnn
A bad shark can kill its family and then you two revenge them. Looking forward to a movie like this
The most gorgeous mammal I've ever seen! Thanks for the up close pic😃

@rmillz8
There is a documentary on Netflix about the belugas in the Georgia Aquarium, BORN TO BE FREE. If you watched it, you would NEVER set foot in that disgusting meat market. They claim to be a “research” facility when all they actually do is promote captivity of creatures that should be free. Enslaving a beluga in a swimming pool is evil. They’re intelligent, family oriented creatures that deserve the same shot at having a family and a happy life as you and your children do! #FreeTheAnimals #StopPromotingCruelty #EmptyTheTanks @Peta
Anytime you need someone to be in movie with you, I'm up for it! Lol.
Seriously in awe of your life!! 😍 beautiful moment x

Animals should not be kept in these places nor used in films for our entertainment. Humans are destroying the planet and degrading animals at our peril. We think we are such an intelligent species but we are the stupidest. I love the Rock but feel this is wrong
That thing is massive.
Le quiere meter un golpe al delfín ,maltrato animal
Diese Tiere gehören in die Freiheit und nicht in ein Aquarium....

"Sorry @therock, been a fan of yours for years, but you’ve gone down in my estimation now. These animals are not here for our entertainment. Georgia aquarium tried to import 18  Beluga’s from Russia, in fact there is a documentary about it called “born to be free”. I urge you to watch it or Blackfish or The Cove. You have a lot of sway with your fans, please don’t encourage them to visit dolphinariums. 
#emptythetanks"
Wow 😍
Beautiful places on the planet. Subscription
@therock I'm crushed! Thought you could do no wrong #blackfish

Ooh.. @therock  im so sad and disappointed 😢 how can you support captivity of such beautiful creatures. Sorry i know you dont care but i cant longer follow you..
Should be a great experience, but beluga aren't whale, they are dolphin
@jesshulsex yea 😂😂
Wow amazing creatures! Love the pic!!😍😍
It’s suffering, release it.  Horrible
If it's so beautiful and regal, then why is it kept in a bathtub? Man is so greedy, selfish, and egotistical to believe any creature wants to be caged or tubbed to engage with man for a lifetime. Why don't they rotate these animals out and just keep them for a year or two and replace thrm with another. Evil.
We loved out visit at the Georgia aquarium a month ago!
@skinnylegendjusto this is the end result of the black market. These animals that are in captivity cannot contribute to the population of their species. Nothing in the world is better off locked up rather than free, regardless of the risks
Dont know what to say. I like you a lot but what I really dont like is animal behind "bars"
@jujuatheart_ swipe text letting me down.  I'm more than happy to argue back with anyone who disagrees with me and clearly hundreds of others luckily but I won't waste my time because obviously not all people will open their eyes
Oh i see you found Bailey. Was Destiny next to him in her tank? 😩
He would be a much better co star then @kevinhart4real 😂🤣

@lewis_sharpe1 @callummordey imagine going to the Aquarium today
Uncle!!!! ❤️ you are honestly a great actor and an even better person! (P.s not really my uncle.... I wish)
All the aquarium warriors.... I'd bet that a majority of these saints have never "had any spare change" for the fellow man ...
This is fuckin awful !!! Should be swimming free in the wild
"I love these animals.
but love when they are in nature. They are battered in aquariums. 😔😔"

Sorry braddah dwayne no like here. Now that you’re the highest paid actor and IG influencer how about giving service to the world by getting rid of animal captivity? Imagine the impact you’d have. You have enough money now actually do something with it
#emptythetanks
These poor creatures should not be kept in captivity , please do not promote anything that helps the industry that profits from their captivity !
Thought that was Kevin Hart for a second
Two leg ends meeting.
I don’t get why everyone is offended by this?

Wrong. Just wrong.
Are you just quoting what the whale said about you?
Do more to protect them and what's happening in Iceland and China. Do more than promote films now you have earned more than you  dreamed of. Change the world. BTW aquariums are cruel. Please read the message as it's a very important message and some one like you had the opportunity to change it. Be the man not the puppet
Watch @blackfish_movie Yes they are Beautiful but they belong in nature not captive in a tank 😢
@izzdagramm
@mishell82 oh dear 😩😢
OMG... So adorable! ❤
@therock noooo! Do some research please. They are awesome but do not belong here.
@valemendozapos16 jajjajaa
@sheawhite1 you need to be on the way to the aquarium... right now
@marine_life_kayaker you just gained a new follower. Love your account!
@therock PLEASE COME TRY OUR NEW GELATO SHOP!!! We’re 30 min north of Atlanta. 440 Chambers Street Woodstock 30188! It would be an honor to have you come by, you’re my absolute favorite actor!!!

Unbelievable!

Should be in the sea not a small@pool alien to them#notocaptivity

@juliedrg hoho
So sweet !!
It's sad to see it in the pool,  not free...
Precious!
For all of you getting triggered take this into consideration. Yes we could let these beautiful creatures back out into the wilderness and everything will be better. But did you think that there are hunters, fishers, and people that want to sell them on the black market? Lots of whales die getting stuck in boat rotors or in nets and usually sink to the bottom of the sea where they die, lots of whales get beached. Just think, what if they're being rehabilitated?
@el_floco06 😍💎💍❣️💝

No no noooo....love you @therock  but this isn’t cool! Use your fame to #emptythetanks not to glamorize this please!!!! 🙏🙏🙏
Thank you for supporting accredited facilities like Georgia Aquarium, who do so much to help educate & promote conservation efforts that support their wild counterparts! You are a wonderful human! 😍🌊🙌🏼
@mrchristiancage that’s quite amusing, if you knew me, I’ve been called insensitive, so many times in my life. Just something I feel strongly about keeping animals in cages and pools. He put it up on social media, so he’s gonna get comments. I admire the Rock a lot, but like I said not his best photo.
He looks so happy! I would be too, if I met The Rock!
Does anyone know which VIP pass this one is? 🖐🏽❤️

They should be back in the ocean, sad thing is they would have to be trained to survive in the ocean bc most of them haven't even been in a ocean, they would be looking for someone to hand out food.

So depressing. How about using your platform to get animals OUT of for-profit captivity and into real sanctuaries ?????? Like seriously WTF there’s so much info out there, learn about it and DO something with your platform and millions!!!! A lot of other people wish they could...
Let it free!!!
Why is he being kept in an aquarium? That’s the equivalent of being in jail. Shame on you for promoting this kind of old-school mindlessness for the sake of entertainment. The rest of us are trying to shut down animal circuses and sea world and this is what you’re doing? Are you going to swim with dolphins next?
Bad.... 👎🏻
@jujuatheart_ haha can’t handle the heat?  These rich stars run their mouth about making a difference and then never walk the walk. Don’t be upset. You were bamboozled! *Hugs
Love it !
Please don't support this @therock
I’m really so disappointed by this gentleman this inspiration to so many getting it so very wrong here. These beautiful animals do not belong in captivity in tiny little baths (remember the ocean is their home) sad for you @therock
@fernlparker @helgarob50
Now I see why you rarely post pictures of you and your family doing regular things. I mean look at all the comments. 😐
Nice 🔥🔥🔥
☹️
Two cuties in one pic? IS it my birthday?
@danrimington It is difficult. We need more guarded waters to protect them in. They are killed more than people realize. I want better for them too.
@danrimington couldn't agree whit you more , took the words right out of my mouth this creature belongs in a open ocean sanctuary or if possible released back in  to the wild not in a aquarium so that humans can gawk at it for there enjoyment/entertainment

"Hi!
The best ever anti-drowning PFD (Personal Floating Device) was developed! First in History - really all needed for safety and most comfortable survive in water emergency. Need support of ethical mecenats! Together We really can save hundreds thousands people this Year! (Each Year about half million people (~ 100K are children) drown for season, and ~1.5 million become invalids, due to anoxemia!).
This Device will change people mind as safety belt in a car did! The same ingenious potential. And the same spreading potential. It gives the most convenient way to care about Your Life-safety.
 Personal Life-care rises common Life-care respectively. So - through  positive mind changing - it will change common world situation to better! 
More over - in fact - it looks very strange when people protect themselves from mosquite, cars, sun, cold and even from rain! And in the same time - leave risk of drowning with no adequate attention. Ignoring that this risk is statistically higher than risk of dying or injuring from a car or fire or even skydiving and rope-jumping! And ignoring the fact human cannot breath in water... even one inhale is impossible.
This device is really a dream of every swimmer! Noble word! 
P.S. According to official W.H.O. statistics - when analysing it closely and deeply - drowning is ~6 time more risky than skydiving! (drown more than 18/100 000 people (region depending), fatal jumps: 3/100 000 solo jumps (group jumps are 2 times more safetier)). And ~9 times more dangerous than a car traffic.
We have to do something with that! Here is the adequate decision. First adequate device in the History.
So Please contact me!
Best regards, Kirill Novitsky."

@official_edna_mode I’m all for stopping whale hunting, global warming and pollution. But that’s not the point here right? You thin this zoo is “saving” animals from getting hunted? And not making a profit on them...? Bruh.
Awe he’s so cute!
@martuwartelski 🖕🏿
It lives in a literal pool. This is no life for these beautiful creatures. I'm actually sick
But first of all you need to ask yourself “Why this beautiful animal ( a marine mammal ) under captivity in a pool @therock stay in peace ✌️
Ric O'Barry trained the Killer Whale (Keiko) in Free Willy, he made a documentary called 'The Cove' I suggest you watch it before you do something in your career you will regret in the longer term! This is not a good thing! Please do not promote this pathetic trade.  They belong in the wild NOT in captivity 😭😭 spirit this around, pleeeease!
@jjosh.adams @radams5599 we did that
You are an intelligent human I beg you please don't promote animal cruelty x
Sad...

Oh man. This is disappointing.  That's a whale swimming in a bath no matter how you spin it - rescue,  medical, rehome or just plain old captive. It shouldn't be there and neither should you. You give captivity creedance with your publicity. Watch #blackfish #thecove #sharkwater and learn about this industry. It's heart breaking. You are an intelligent man with a big heart but this is misguided and deeply disappointing to some of your fans.
That’s adorable

😂😂😍😍
@josh.521 there’s a difference between an animal sanctuary and an aquarium/zoo. One is for profit and the other is to ensure the well-being of the sentient beings.
Dwayne dappin up a whale like even nature’s beasts know what the fucks goin on
@morgan_gout19 😄😄😄

This is so genuine. Like. These animals are so intelligent we don't even realize it!!
Sorry, but this “beautiful animal” does NOT belong in a friggin pool or cage.

@jordanxwalker holy crap the rocks dropped a bollock when it comes to his pr image. Seen the comments wow.
Probably better acting than @kevinhart jk

Staggering intelligence,that should be in the wild.:(
Look at the lat on that guy too. That whale has been working on his V-taper for sure.
@nordstromt this is bad ass!
😂 Geez you’re a good human.. The dad jokes are next level.. I knew it was coming but that makes it all the better! Keep making the world a better place @therock 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽

I know you’re giving him a fist bump but it kinda looks like you’re gleefully punching that whale in the face
Unfollowed like a motherfucker you disappointed me on another level #emptythetanks💯💯💯

Yeah just look at it, trapped in a pool out of the wild, how lovely
@seeredd09 look! Two of my favorite creatures 😩

Oh my god that is a beautiful beautiful creature. ❤️. @therock
@zarishgill
I see this photo of Dwayne and I, but I don’t remember this moment?!?!? How can I not?!???
سبحان الله
OMG your face says it all!
One of the few shameful things you’ll likely ever see the Rock doing. C’mon Dwayne you’re better than this. Captivity is torcher, and wrong. #blackfish #thecove
@kevinhart4real Probably able to act better then U🙈
Super
Wtf 😂
No hay nada bueno en lo que estás haciendo. Tu eres una gran persona, porqué vas a hacer una película usando a animales que han sido secuestrados de su hábitat, alejados de su familia y maltratados para domarlos?? Por favor Roca, renuncia a ese proyecto. Investiga, mira el documental BLACKFISH y conoce la realidad. 💔💔💔💔
@yaafavvtiffanny you took a selfie with the rock whaaa
It’s so incredible
Son los mas hermosos del mundo
Looks so good that it looks photoshopped
This whale has seen nothing but a concrete tank it's whole life . why oh why are you joking or not about it performing ' being your co star' animals are not for entertainment. And the promotion of this is utterly wrong
Are you FOR REAL? Arghhhhh this beautiful whale should not be in a damn tank. I am also joining the unfollow group! Actually thought you were cool but it’s a big NO from me
I have the same picture of you and Bubba
@gcan12 my point was exactly that. Wrote it wrongly but even so...

Unfollowing now 😔 shouldn’t be promoting this kind of cruelty, you said  beautiful animal with staggering intelligence... living in a tiny tank bored out of his brain, stolen from the wild or born in captivity and then taken from his mother and starved so he’ll you a hi-5 in exchange of a dead fish filled with Xanax to keep him subdued 😔😔😔 #emptythetanks
Why is everyone giving the rock so much hate about this. Yes animals belong in their natural habitat, but most of you that are complaining know that if you went to an aquarium you would be amazed. So stop attacking him.
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Beluga whales don’t belong in captivity. #cruelty #captivitykills
I didn't expect you to support something like that...
@ashleyann_87 😊
Rip Rampage albino George
@mimiaffy doesn’t matter if it’s tiny or not!!! It shouldn’t be in captivity anyway!!!
😍
You lost a fan. All animals should live in freedom not in a fish tank or a cage. I thought  you were more than that. So sad.
Can’t believe I’m seeing you promoting aquariums. This is very disappointing.
So envious right now. I absolutely love animals and 1 day will finally get to be up close to dolphins etc.
No, no, no!!! Yes, an amazing creature. No, it should not be in captivity. Nor promoted as entertainment.

Your right. Staggering intelligence but kept a prisoner and praised for its staggering intelligence by mindless fools. But then your an actor aren't you. So some one obviously told you to pose with this poor sad prisoner and tell the world it's intelligent. Guess What?  We knew!
Intelligent, beautiful animals... that are locked up in a pool. @therock it would be even better if you could use your influence to protect ocean wildlife in their natural habitat.
That caption though 😂😂
Nice
Aquariums aren’t great....... unless it’s a certified sanctuary, it’s mostly for profit even if some people care who work there. It’s for spectacle and not for the well-being of the sentient animals. I’d encourage you to begin aligning with animal sanctuaries instead of promoting animal captivity. ✌🏼
So Nice🔥🔥🔥🍀

Hahahaha very cool
@tef48 @topherkno If this is indeed the Georgia Aquarium, one of their Belugas came from SeaWorld. I cannot tell which whale this is, so I cannot accurately claim this is the individual from SeaWorld, but I can confirm the Belugas they have originally were not rescues. One of their whales even died in 2015 from heart issues and most of the babies the Belugas had died. This same aquarium in 2012 was trying to import wild caught Belugas from Russia until someone told them it was a no no and would encourage more animal trading. Lots of aquariums rightfully faced backlash after Blackfish came out, so a majority started working with charities to help the oceans they aided in harming. I am on board with aquariums now aiding in ocean conservation and repair, but I am sad that all of the whales that are housed in small tanks could be given larger tanks, now that we understand it's like keeping a human in a bathroom sized room their whole life. I know someone may read this and think I'm aggressively bashing or supporting the aquarium, but this isn't the case. I think good people who love animals work in aquariums, but sometimes the people who own aquariums care more about money than they do the actual animals.
Wow 😍😍❤❤

As much as I like you as an actor etc I don't believe you should be promoting keeping an animal like this in a pool. They should be in the wild and enjoying the environment they belong

Bye bye Kevin
@rls_323 yeah totally get what you mean and i wasn’t going to attack anyone but i just wanted to point out that these animals like whales and dolphins are huge and really belong in their natural habitat whilst the natural habitat of cats and dogs became our houses ..☺️
So cool 😎
Amazing !
Delfino 😻
Why is this even happening in this day and age , do you have any idea on how far they travel out in freedom!!!! There is a walrus that looks absolutely sick in captivity somewhere over there and no one is doing nothing!!!! They are not here for our entertainment!!!!!!! I’m actually sad that iv seen you in this situation
That’s one of my favorite animal
@lunachic18
Bro what ever u did and what ever u will do.... god bless you ☝🏼
@emil_jonsson he didn't say that. He said that he liked his new co-star
Very nice
Dude your smarter than this #blackfish
It is very weird how you do not have any compassion for this poor animals locked in an aquarium.Comes from someone like you it's disappointing. Rethink your concepts!
People really need to educate themselves on animal cruelty! This may not look like cruelty but it is! Animals living in tiny tanks, torn away from their families doing tricks for you is cruelty. Free them and put them back in to the wild where they belong!! #emptythetanks
Rock is the man
👏👏👏👏👏
💓💝
@therock, I am in awe of ALL in this picture! The Beluga whales look so majestic and serene.

This is life. ❣️

@xeerina

Why u hittin that poor animal 😂😂😂
@johnny_masters seriously!? Lol
@peta now hates you lol
You said they are beautiful, you said they are intelligent yet you condemn the rock for snapping with one. If someone had not kept them in the aquariums your so called cages, probably to study their behaviour, would you have known all this about whales? I hate when people support nonsense! They belong to the wild, wild! Wild!! Wild!!! Shut the fuck up! What are they doing in the wild? Work? Oh! I guess I know the answer already... They cause problems in the sea... Like sinking ships and causing havoc on fleets and its occupants... I just got to know from this picture that you can shake hands with a whale and still have you hands in good condition. I believe its the other way round in the wild sea though. Nice job @georgiaaquarium @therock
Disappointed
So adorable!
Wow !
👏👏👏👏👏

@streetartglobe that’s like offensive to the beluga whale
@therock sad that this beautiful and intelligent animal is stuck in a pool
I thought a man from hawaii loves nature and animals in there. Real Nature, no zoos or aquariums. Why support animals in small aquariums that are kept in jail just for humans...disgusting, sry just my opinion...whales and big fishes need the wide ocean, no aquarium 👎🏻

That’s awesome!
Wow... so great!
@itspapidyl rip
How cool 😍
New friend for the Rock, cool 😎
Ugh I wish I was that Beluga  @kylerchase85
Sweet cargo shorts rock
@therock Pretty disappointed you're missing the tragic situation this beautiful animal is in. Don't glorify the cruelty that this animal is suffering, step up and be the voice for those creatures that don't have one.
@nicolle1013
No animal, intelligent or not, should be kept in a kiddy pool away from their natural habitat. Very sad 😕
He’s just handsome @therock
You guys should have dabbed
@demonsaremysidekicks soon
@mrchristiancage your an uneducated fud!! Microwave your brain further for enlightenment !
Use your power .. hell make a film..that fantasic mammal..needs to be free not in a tank .
Let’s give the @therock the benefit of the doubt and advise whether these belugas are there for a reason and can’t survive in the wild - this aquarium may be for rehabilitation or research to help the greater population. This doesn’t look good from a first glance, but let’s hope Dwayne still has his heart
Wow absolutely incredible 👌
i’ve met that whale. he owes me 12 bucks.
Love you but this is a huge nope.
Same hair style Dwayne 😘

Should you not know it better? Animals in aquarium or zoo are basically prisoners, and life for these animals is basically dominated by torture!

Img! Beluga whale? Looks like a white dolphin!? I wouldn't even know the difference?!
On my bucket list to pet a beluga whale!
this is the most beautiful picture ever taken
Such a disappointment. Empty the tanks. This beautiful creature needs to be swimming free not performing cheap tricks to earn you and others money
Como haces para que tu cabeza brille tanto bro?

So disappointed to see this photo. How can you say you’re in awe of a tortured, captive animal being kept alive for the sole purpose of entertaining humans? It’s 2018... I thought everyone knew that keeping wild animals in captivity for our consumption is prehistoric and barbaric. Hope you read all the comments and think twice about supporting this bullshit. Time to unfollow... 😡🙄🤦🏼‍♀️
Dude please watch blackfish and rethink.

@savannah.nora.vickers  remember this whale!

Maaan, I love Dwayne so much.... but we need these celebs on the other side of the fight to #emptythetanks these babies need their freedom

She is so cute!!! I wish they were not in captivity....

So cool
Wonderful

@bflynn87 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Beluga ❤️
@poisonthewill I bet this pic really does something to you
@danrimington oh yeah lets just release them so they can be hunted until extinction. Or maybe perhaps leave the idea up to you?
Hahaahah
He just said the same thing on his Instagram 😂

I’m crying. You’re costarring with a Beluga Whale. @therock + a porpoise = literally two of my fave things in one movie. Ticket sold. Keep us posted 🤟🏼🧡☀️
You two have the same shape of head. 😄
Next to @kevinhart4real, that's probably a hard choice 😂
Please do better, and use your platform to educate the public on why facilities like the #GeorgiaAquarium are unethical, inhuman and just plan outdated. Until then, you've lost a fan and a follower.

Great shot!!
@jonah_lindquist check youtube videos or other blogs. There are PLENTY of them. But of course, only if you want to do some research you will know the truth. It is easier to think they are cute and they are happy there because it looks as if they were smiling
@kristenbourgoin
@therock you should go to #churchillmanitoba Canada and see them in their natural environment.
Bridging the bold gap between the kingdoms 😏
@therock not the smartest move posing  with a captive animal and promoting their use in movies.

You should see how amazing they are when they aren’t being held captive.
Lost a fan in me, don’t promote keeping these animals in captivity. You say they’re intelligent yet you can’t comprehend how being in captivity is cruel and how they understand that
The rock. The whale and the Kevin hart. Sounds like a hit movie
Wow! A bigger and more beautiful co-star? Didn't think I'd see the day lol!
This shouldn’t be in captivity, sort it out Dwayne

Hello

It’s truly an amazing feeling!!
@thebrandon26
@stevev19 they are already in the aquarium....and most of the money these aquariums raise goes towards conservation efforts and positive things for the future of the animals outside of the aquarium.

Oh no... this is not on. How can you promote such animal cruelty... do you know how that beautiful sentinel creature got there? Do you know why it “performs” like that? @dolphin_project
😊😍❤
Why you punching that white dolphin?
@ct_steelman TAKE ME TO THE GEORGIA AQUARIUM SO I CAN MEET THE ROCK.

These beautiful creatures deserve their natural home. That’s what the ocean is for. To give life to these animals. Please don’t support animal cruelty because that’s exactly what this is
@sirkhirrk

@its_jason_waterfalls even the Rock is in awe of these creatures
As a person who was infatuated with aquariums and Sea Worlds, I know feel sorry for these animals.
Disappointing #emptythetanks 😔🐳🐋🐬🦈
@therock you make that beluga whale look normal size. I was with some belugas over at San Diego and they are huge.
Wow, Beluga! They come down the St. Lawrence river. What a strange beautiful animal.

@therock Please don't support aquariums that confine these beautiful animals from a free life in the ocean which is their birth right.. Please
😢😢😢
Wow. What a Beautiful Creature. You don't look too bad either Sir🙏🏻🐯🇬🇧😍😉
Não importa quem vc é, se @therock sorri pra vc, vc se apaixona.
@psampaio20 a baleia com down hahahahahah
@amyle07 well said. No marine creature would shake your hand,  this is cruel.  Safe injured whales yes but don't turn them into entertainment.
@miajadehiggins 💕
@therock take him through leg day and see how happy he is after
What a great idea! How about a storyline where you’re back in San Diego, this time at Sea World, and you’re an ocean animal expert. Global warming is forcing us to build giant cooling tanks to keep our ocean animals alive. The tanks are connected so animals can be moved and bred as we struggle to keep all species alive. Maybe the bad guys are accelerating natural selection and beluga is the next Einstein. Cut to you and beluga saving the world! 💕🌎🐋

Usually love your positive message but using your Instagram to promote keeping cetaceans like the beautiful beluga whale in captivity for human entertainment is truly misguided. Please educate yourself on the complex and active lives these animals have in the wild, and reconsider promoting exploitative facilities such as the #GeorgiaAquarium. They have had a number of beluga whale and whale shark deaths, it's just not possible to keep these sensitive animals in a concrete tank and have them maintain happy and healthy lives. They also have fought long and hard to import wild caught whales. Please see, https://www.ajc.com/news/beluga-whales-get-their-day-court/2Jmbq1nCUFzpFRKM5WCEzJ/?icmp=np_inform_variation-control

I love you so much Rock , but that just reinforces the permission to have in captivity animals that belong in the wild... and do stuff they are not supposed to do . Too sad. And too bad.
How can you be in awe of a tortured animal? Lost so much respect for you over this pic. Hope you read the comments and reconsider.

Oooowwwtiiiiiiiiii 😍😍😍😍😍😘💝💝💝
First of all I’m a rock fan. So this isn’t hate directed at him. Secondly (most importantly) it kills me that in 2018 we still, as a civilisation have not learnt that these beautiful animals are not for us. Not for our entertainment. Not for us to show our children too and post on social media. I don’t care how nice this inclosure May see from the outside looking in or what the trainers might tell us is best for the animal. Animals being kept like this are prisoners. For no reason apart from just being a different species. It upsets me that people with voices. Like DJ. Don’t see what I see when they visit these places. Instead they post a picture. 🙄🤬😢

Oh my goodness!  @therock that beluga has a perpetual smile like you!

Even if you are not interested in my opinion, I am very disappointed that you support animal cruelty. No whale should live in captivity. Take a picture with a human captive and smile. That’ll be fairer, because the human captive is a criminal, but the whale is innocent ... #emptythetanks and #freethewhales

@_monicha 💫😮
I took part in the beluga encounter at this aquarium and it was the greatest experience I've ever had. These animals are unbelievably happy and are well taken care of. They are well fed, playful, and full of joy. So many animals are dying in their natural habitats due to things like the red tide and it is almost more likely they will live a longer life in the caring hands of the @georgiaaquarium 🐳
AQUARIUMS SHOULD BE SHUTDOWN, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM!!..if you want to learn about Sea Creatures...go enter their domain...not vice versa...zoos Are just as bad...I dont support Anyplace that Holds animals CAPTIVE my g!

The bestttttttt
@griselgamarra I do agree that they do not belong in captivity, but some animals are there because they were hurt or because the people are trying to protect the species. I’m not trying to argue though. I do believe that animals belong in the wild but because of humans their habitats are disappearing rapidly
Unfollowing you @therock this is not okey to treat a animal like this! Disgrasse is what you are and young kids is looking up to you! they shouldnt do it! Lost all my respect! I used to hav chickens and only time they where looked in was when they were sleeping and that was them who chosing when to sleep and where to sleep otherwise they had almost 8000 square meters garden to walk free and allmost 80000 square meters in total if you count the forrest we owned! Free the Beluga ✌
Cool pic @therock, still I'm worried about these animals living in these water tanks..they belong into the ocean🐋🐳🐬🐟🐠
@therock #georgiaaquarium is the best ever ❤️
Free the mammals in captivity tanks, they belong in the ocean Dwayne ‼️

I am to say the least a huge fan of yours, but after this post I can’t begin to explain how appalled and disgusted I am. I definitely thought you were more in touch then this.
@kup93 😂😂
Best man in the world😍😍😍
@streetartglobe hahahahhaa  Somewhat similar
Perfect 😍
Sad and disappointing. Hate that you’re promoting this kind of thing. Think about it.
It looks fake its real u brave ah
Check my story
@therock please don’t promote such places. You know the best place for these mammals and other sea creatures is to be in the sea!! You can’t be this hungry for publicity
Wow you people are triggered big time.
We did this, as well as the whale shark swim! Georgia aquarium rocks!!
Love ❤
So beautiful, terrible what is happening to animals habitat around the 🌍
@mrreddington77 whats wrong
@oh___juan  amorrr yo quiero
@instomgram7 so jealous 😍😩
@negr0mante no vabbè! 😆
No way..the rock vs the flipper... Big man vs big fish in one fishy battle of the ages.... 🤦
@mrreddington77 its not cool, his celebrity could impact change for these creatures, to get them back to the oceans, to get them back to theor families, to stop the exploitation of sea life in captivity. Nothing about this is cool, watch Blackfin!!!!
My favorite animal on the planet 💞.
Taller than Kevin Hart
So...wait - which one is the Rock?
Sooo cute!!!!
The Beluga clearly has the advantage over the Bull in water, Crykey what a time to be alive! #dopepic
The beluga whale is cool but the water is balls freezing
You are going to remain in many of us including myself for a lifetime. Thank you for contributing continuously to most of our lifes'. Can't wait to see you right where you are and hope we can continue to #wanderinginparadise @wanderinginparadise

@thatgirlbrenda
@therock how did it not pop in to your head that you're exploiting animals and promoting captivity? Or maybe it did and you just didn't care... what if it was the other way round and you weren't top of the food chain.
@thatgirlbrenda
Wow great man
@minoritynomad I’m vegan, so what’s your point? Straw man argument?
That whale has been skipping fin day I see...

I’m beyond disappointed! Why would you promote animal cruelty?
Два лысых здоровенных, круть
Oh no! This makes me sad on so many levels. I never ever thought one of my favourite actors would promote animal cruelty 😞
Im waiting for someone to photoshop @kevinhart4real face on this
@leonardodicaprio...looks like @therock could do with a lesson in #animalwelfare issues 💔
Read up on Georgia Aquarium and their treatment of their animals.
So dissapointed by this... please get your facts on animal cruelty, this beautiful creature should be free in the ocean, not in the fish tank for your entertaiment !!!!
They should be free. It’s sad that you’ve promoted this 💔
Haha awesome

Oh no 😭🤦🏼‍♀️
@therock Looks like you just punched that white privilege ass whale
Should be in the wild...
You will walk away and live your life just the way you choose while he is stuck there as a prisoner, his freedom completely taken away from him, for the rest of his long and miserable life. Shame on you @therock. I really, truly thought you would be smarter than this. Oh and read up on #georgiaaquarium bc they have come under fire for the companies they have contracted with to capture these whales from the wild. It’s absolutely sickening.
Stop it.  This is amazing.  Love this picture 🖤🖤
@mrchristiancage whales and dolphins are not suited to captivity. A person has a right to (very politely) point that out. Then you come along with your abusive and unnecessary comment. Who’s the one with a complete lack of social skills, etiquette and inability to live without judgement 🤔🤦🏻‍♀️
Wow beautiful 🌺
I too am brilliant beautiful and awesome. Also pale chubby and like to swim.
Noooo @therock I hate seeing intelligent animals like this 😭

@ct_trismegistus rescued whales don't perform or do tricks
@i_am_demo how? Majority of the comments are ‘amazing’. They only amazing part about it is human beings still use this beautiful animals for our sick entertainment. They are not court jesters. They deserve just as much a life as we do.

Terrible! You lost me as a fan
My favoriteeeee😍😍😍
Poor animals... Their life is so sad. Being captured in a concrete bathtub is so cruel. Please support to free them all into sanctuaries and don't support those aquariums. Watching them in the ocean is 1000x better!
Y would u hurt that beautiful thing
I literally cannot w/ u 😭💕
Beautiful Creature. Not impressed by its living conditions though. Should be left free in the Ocean

This aquarium is awful, they tried to get 18 of those beautiful, intelligent animals taken from their home and imported from Russia to sit in their tanks. Thank god they were denied.

@therock Man with all respect (even because I admire you too much) a man with his character, position, influence and respect should criticize and position himself against keeping animals in captivity for mere human amusement, especially when dealing with an endangered species, with all my respect.
I expected more from you! Ban aquariums! They belong in the ocean!

Dolphs in the frame now👌😻😍
I'd like to understand this situation better.  I love the Rock, but find this disappointing.  What's the difference between this and Sea World?
Hahahaha You get along well @therock
@therock why do you promote animals in captivity? Huge unfollow..... I had so much respect for you ........ not anymore. This beautiful creatures should be free 😡

Amazing 💯
@therock it’s got your hairline 😂
@cross_inverted I LOVE THIS IMAGE SO MUCH
@therock this is animal Cruelty. Whyyyy are you supporting this. Its horrible for the animals. Beeing in captivity just for stupid humans who enjoy cruel things like  this🤤🤤😳😳😠😠😠#boycottseaworld #animalcruelty
Wow

Animals are not here for our entertainment.
@haleymonk @glomonk Go to the aquarium! @therock is there playing with Belugas!
@annie_laventure
Hi guys.. Plz Follow me🔥@bestshotz_world 😍
Whales and dolphins DOESN'T belong in a aquarium!
Nice one
Maaaaaaan I wanted to go to the #GeorgiaAquarium today to celebrate my birthday that's tmrw. Seeing you @therock would have been the best birthday ever!!!
@walid_msr le beluga le vrai
#blackfish
No debería estar encerrada 😑
God bless
Ugh this is so disappointing @therock. You are smarter than this. Think about his life, swimming in circles for decades, in a concrete tank, begging for dead fish. We have to use our heads and be better than this.
Cetaceans do not belong in captivity! Please, please watch Blackfish before you consider visiting anywhere else which holds these incredible, intelligent creatures in such small tanks.
two words air bus
@ryantuziopt neck twins
Empty the tanks😭

@joseqs9411 mientras tú estás en el Dolphin la rock habla con ellos
Rampage?
Now the rock is out there punching whales while they try and high give him 😂😂 jk that’s badass

We can learn so much from animals .. sometimes more then people ❤️❤️❤️🇨🇦🌹🌹🙏🏼

WHY?! why consider this in a film?! please don’t do this.. this is animal cruelty
🤗🤗🤗🤗
Why are you promoting and supporting captive sea animals? It’s a hideous, cruel, and very sad thing to see these beautiful intelligent (some smarter than humans) creatures stuck in a tiny featureless tank for pathetic entertainment for dumb fuck humans. We are a plague to our Mother Earth and it’s wildlife and nature in general. Killing all the beauty and joy we’ve been given. Freedom is not an option for these animals yes freedom is a promoted thing amount humans. You’re one of my favorites Dwayne but this is very disappointing and I have lost respect for you 😔

If you disagree with keeping healthy whale sharks captive for profit like I do then click on my profile and sign my petition to free them from this aquarium! 🙏🏻❤️
Fico  feliz por você 😁@therock ❤
They are kind of Russians, by origin 😊 I'm proud ))
Can’t follow you anymore Rock. That’s two now, the alligator pic and now this. You should have known better to make a movie using captured creatures. Yes they are beautiful but not if they’re locked up. And their intelligence supersedes all of us. As nice of a guy that you seem to be, you really don’t seem to understand your influence...
Dolphin Tale 3. Exactly what we all wanted 👀

This is super cool kinda funny looking haha
Ai q tudo
@therock , it takes a big man to be a voice of reason and have compassion in his heart and true appreciation and gratitude for God's creatures. You could change the world, YOU have the power to move people.... #blackfish please stand up and do something!!!!!!!
@shivani.sheth7
Georgia Aquarium has a bad reputation with Beluga whale deaths. Enough said. 😓😰😢
😍😭❤️❤️
Wow!
❤
Awesome 😎
This is disgusting and despicable these animals suffer living in these tanks. They are not our property nor are they are entertainment. Will never see this movie👎👎
@urfavmarissa the rock is actually going there and probably paying to be there. Stop visiting those places is what he could do.
Shame @therock 😔

Not cool, Dwayne. I hope you don't continue to support marina mammal captivity.

Do you have job for me
Ive been wanting to go to this aquarium for years!! that is an awesome pic @therock .  Had to be a great experience.
Awww... great pic to put next to your hardcore "do you smell what the Rock is cookin" pics 😂
@gmurrayb @williams.elli

Belongs in the wild!
Big mistake posting this
U mean if Kevin were bald ,white and pudgy....kidding, love u guys and your work. Man I am envious because Mr. Beluga looks like a kool cat I could hang with,lol ;)

Mad the way you've both got the fucking same shaped head lad.

Beautiful, but it is not free😞 it is in captivity😟
Your the best
Awesome
@therock I’m greatly disappointed that you are supporting this kind of cruelty or even using this poor animal as part of a film project. Please educate yourself in the horrors of aquariums and how these poor animals are stolen from their pods in the wild, stuck in too small pools, suffer on a daily basis from stress and boredom. You just lost a fan. 😔
Great picture
wow!!!!! súper!!!!!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍😘😘😘😘

This is unbelievable @therock! This animal should not be living in captivity! That's the point where I stop follow you!
You should be laying the smackdown on these horrible places and their jabroni CEOs not promoting it
@tef48 I'm not big on animals in captivity, but what is your opinion if it actually was a rescue?

@jeannetteebruno Agreed 🙌🏼
@danrimington totally agree. These animals aren't smiling, or happy. They are incredibly intelligent with strong family bonds and most certainly not deserve a life of performing tricks in return for dead fish.  Times are changing #emptythetanks
@rike_vdg
@tef48 stupid comment. He didn’t even do anything wrong, What the fuck do you expect him to do? What are you doing about animal cruelty except sitting at home commenting on this.

If you were so in awe of these creatures, you would respect them and go and try see them in the wild instead of these horrible places. Lost all respect for you. You could do so much to help these animals.
@cande_antunez10
That beautiful creature should be in the wild not in a pool. You should be letting people know how disgusting this is. Still love you man just think about the things you promote.

So sad to see you think that it’s ok to keep this beautiful, intelligent animal locked up in a swimming pool for the rest of its life. 😢
If you love them so much you shouldn’t support places such as this.

@danrees92 ah you can swim with these at seaworld

Wow awesome pic man!
@prattner
@saramileham I'm forever associating you with Belugas now 👍😄🤗
@maylisfranceries jtm❤️
Beautiful creatures and lovely photo but you should not be doing this. These animals should not be kept in captivity and 'trained' to do these tricks. You are a very famous person with a big voice and a lot of listeners, you should be using that power to stop this abuse not encourage me and be a tourist giving yet more income to these abusement parks/aquariums etc.

haven’t seen rampage yet but this makes me want to watch it
it's amazing 😍
@therock dude, you should be in awe of these creatures in their own environment. Co-starring Whales are not cool. You’re doing it for a movie. For money. They don’t give af about money. Let them be 💙🤙🏻

Wow like touch mamal great job therock ◇☆♡
Would be much more beneficial to use your position in this world to highlight the problems of captive held whales and dolphins and campaign for their freedom - obviously injuries which prevent them being returned to the wild are understandable, but we must ensure their welfare and environment is as close to that of what they’d experience in the wild
@dan_johnston92

Imagine yourself in captivity for others’ entertainment... I am shocked, you should be aware of animal rights...

Oh no!! Belugas are social animals. They communicate using a language of clicks, whistles & clangs 💙 But belugas at marine parks are denied everything natural & important to them. NEVER go to a marine park that exploits animals for entertainment!

Aquariums are good for the soul, if there’s ever one in a city I’m at, I always make a point of stopping
@disneystextposts because most of the time when you bite your tongue accidentally, it's bexusse you're Chewing, and when you're Chewing, it's with full force, and without thought. So of course that will hurt more.
Cooooooollllll 😎😎😎😎😎
Wow fantastique!!!

I think i can see @kevinhart4real  in the photo 😂😂 JK
Oh shit that's real at first i didn't know what that was 🙈
Сегодня ехал на автобусе домой. Сел и начал слушать музыку. Ко мне присела странная женщина. Она поздоровалась со мной и дала мне какой-то листочек с цифрами. Сказала на счастье. Я продолжил слушать музыку. Вдруг в автобус влетают омоновцы. Я очень испугался. Они начали обыскивать всех. И вдруг они дошли до той женщины. Они нашли какой-то чемодан с кодовым замком. Женщину сразу повязали. Омоновцы спросили:,, никто ли не видел листочек с кодом?" И тут я вспомнил про тот листок. Я отдал их омону. Один из омоновцев начал очень боязно открывать этот чемодан. Когда они открыли его, они обнаружили там лапшу, которую я вам щас вешаю на уши.

Why? Oh why? 🙈 Come on! I can’t believe you support these kind of things, you are the Rock! 😳 He is in captivity, nothing to praise there. Those places with dolphins or whales or animals in captivity shouldn’t exist. They are just “nice jails” for the animals ☹️
