<p>The Koran is organized into chapters, called Surahs. There are 114 Surahs in the Koran,
each divided into verses.
In this Surah 49, the Moon, we find this longest repeated phrase. It is a little spooky:</p>

Easy for warning have we made the Koran-but, is there anyone who receives the warning?

The Adites called the truth a lie: but how great was my vengeance and my menace;

For we sent against them a roaring wind in a day of continued distress:

It tore men away as though they were uprooted palm stumps.

And how great was my vengeance and my menace!
