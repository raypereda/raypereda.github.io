Last paragraph:\n27:27 And know ye that ye shall be judges of this people, according to the judgment which I shall give unto you, which shall be just. Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am. Imagine the young Mormon people establishing a successful community in 1823. A 17-year old Joseph Smith was focused on creating laws that support the community. This reminds me of a quote from Socrates:\nThose who are too smart to engage in politics are punished by being governed by those who are dumber I believe that BoM spirit would approve of that message as well.\nThe BoM is about setting up a community (nation?) of people with a shared values from the people from Israel. When I think of trouble with national politics, a constitution that is not resolving problems quickly, and a border that is out of control, I see politics as an essential topic for all citizen, young and old, powerful and meek, everyone.\nEnd Notes: Big thanks to Joshua Lisec for giving me the nudge to look at repeated phrases in BoM.\nMegaPatterns counts all of the repeated phrases. For sake of studying human prose, it limits the results on the website to only the top 40 repeated phrases for each length. The repeating short phrases are typically plentiful; for the longer phrases, there are few repeats. I don’t show a word count of the length of the phrase, but my add if helpful.\nHere’s a Google sheet for tinkering with the repeats. I recommend tinkering with filtering the rows with filters.\n",

</code></pre><p>Here is the first and last paragraphs that mention the word judges.</p>
<p>First paragraph:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>29:11 Therefore I will be your king the remainder of my days;
nevertheless, let us appoint judges, to judge this people according to
our law; and we will newly arrange the affairs of this people, for we
will appoint wise men to be judges, that will judge this people
according to the commandments of God.
</code></pre><p>Last paragraph:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>27:27 And know ye that ye shall be judges of this people, according to
the judgment which I shall give unto you, which shall be just.
Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you,
even as I am.

Joseph Smith was focused on creating laws that support the community. This reminds
me of a quote from Socrates:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Those who are too smart to engage in politics are punished
by being governed by those who are dumber
</code></pre><p>I believe that BoM spirit would approve of that message as well.</p>
<p>The BoM is about setting up a community (nation?) of people with a shared values from the people from
Israel. When I think of trouble with national politics, a constitution that is not resolving problems quickly, and a border that is out of control, I see politics as an essential topic for all citizen, young and old, powerful and meek, everyone.</p>

<p>Big thanks to <a href="https://lisecghostwriting.com/">Joshua Lisec</a> for giving me the nudge to look at repeated phrases in BoM.</p>
<p>MegaPatterns counts all of the repeated phrases. For sake of studying human prose, it limits the results on the website to only the top 40 repeated phrases for each length. The repeating short phrases are typically plentiful; for the longer phrases, there are few repeats. I don&rsquo;t show a word count of the length of the phrase, but my add if helpful.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_vk4S9S1Lsg28WrZmGTT-Vn0wyEgW7ZEohNe5HF_wOQ/edit?usp=sharing">Google sheet</a> for tinkering with the repeats. I recommend tinkering with filtering the rows with filters.</p>
