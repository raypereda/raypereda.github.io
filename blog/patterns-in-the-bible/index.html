First let&rsquo;s look at the longest repeats, it is repeated once. In the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament, we find this long phrase that says that Hezekiah&rsquo;s house was fancy.
The Second Book of the Kings
20:13 And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.">

<p>Let&rsquo;s find the repeated phrases in the bible.</p>
<p>The text is available here:
[The King James Version of the Bible]
(<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10">http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10</a>)</p>
<p>First let&rsquo;s look at the longest repeats, it is repeated once.
In the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament, we find this long phrase that says that Hezekiah&rsquo;s house was <em><strong>fancy</strong></em>.</p>
<p>The Second Book of the Kings</p>
<p>20:13 And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all <em><strong>the house
of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and
the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that
was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all
his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.</strong></em></p>
<p>39:2 And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them <em><strong>the house of his
precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the
precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was
found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his
dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.</strong></em></p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at a medium length phrase with 11 repeats:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>after their families, by the house of their fathers, 
according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward,
</code></pre><p>All repeats are in this book:
The Fourth Book of Moses or Numbers.
This is Torah, the Hebrew Bible, or Old Testament.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the first example.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>1:18 And they assembled all the congregation together on the
first day of the second month, and they declared their pedigrees after
their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number
of the names, from twenty years old and upward, by their polls.
</code></pre><p>These passages are about organizing the men, age 20+. Probably mostly
prepping for war.</p>
<p>These are shorter multi-word phrases with high repeats:</p>

</code></pre><p>The LORD is in most of the phrases.
What does the LORD do?
Mostly he spake/talked, especially to Moses.</p>
<p>The most repeated phrase is
&ldquo;the children of Israel&rdquo;, repeated 633 times.</p>
<p>I think this book is most relevant to Jewish people because
they are the grown-ups from Israel today.</p>
